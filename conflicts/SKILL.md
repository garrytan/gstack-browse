  Cross-PR semantic conflict predictor. Analyzes all open PRs against the current
  branch to detect textual merge conflicts, semantic collisions (overlapping state
  machines, shared APIs, competing migrations), and suggests optimal merge ordering.
  Use when: multiple PRs in flight, "will this conflict?", "merge order", "PR triage".

## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_UPD=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-update-check 2>/dev/null || .claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-update-check 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -n "$_UPD" ] && echo "$_UPD" || true
mkdir -p ~/.gstack/sessions
touch ~/.gstack/sessions/"$PPID"
_SESSIONS=$(find ~/.gstack/sessions -mmin -120 -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
find ~/.gstack/sessions -mmin +120 -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
_CONTRIB=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config get gstack_contributor 2>/dev/null || true)
```

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/gstack-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined). If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running gstack v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

## AskUserQuestion Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. Context: project name, current branch, what we're working on (1-2 sentences)
2. The specific question or decision point
3. `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]`
4. Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...`

If `_SESSIONS` is 3 or more: the user is juggling multiple gstack sessions and context-switching heavily. **ELI16 mode** — they may not remember what this conversation is about. Every AskUserQuestion MUST re-ground them: state the project, the branch, the current plan/task, then the specific problem, THEN the recommendation and options. Be extra clear and self-contained — assume they haven't looked at this window in 20 minutes.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. When you hit friction with **gstack itself** (not the user's app), file a field report. Think: "hey, I was trying to do X with gstack and it didn't work / was confusing / was annoying. Here's what happened."

**gstack issues:** browse command fails/wrong output, snapshot missing elements, skill instructions unclear or misleading, binary crash/hang, unhelpful error message, any rough edge or annoyance — even minor stuff.
**NOT gstack issues:** user's app bugs, network errors to user's URL, auth failures on user's site.

**To file:** write `~/.gstack/contributor-logs/{slug}.md` with this structure:

```
# {Title}

Hey gstack team — ran into this while using /{skill-name}:

**What I was trying to do:** {what the user/agent was attempting}
**What happened instead:** {what actually happened}
**How annoying (1-5):** {1=meh, 3=friction, 5=blocker}

## Steps to reproduce
1. {step}

## Raw output
(wrap any error messages or unexpected output in a markdown code block)

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {gstack version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```

Then run: `mkdir -p ~/.gstack/contributor-logs && open ~/.gstack/contributor-logs/{slug}.md`

Slug: lowercase, hyphens, max 60 chars (e.g. `browse-snapshot-ref-gap`). Skip if file already exists. Max 3 reports per session. File inline and continue — don't stop the workflow. Tell user: "Filed gstack field report: {title}"

## Agent Team Awareness

```bash
_TEAM_CONFIG=$(find ~/.claude/teams/ -name "config.json" -newer ~/.gstack/sessions/"$PPID" 2>/dev/null | head -1 || true)
_IS_TEAMMATE=$([ -n "$_TEAM_CONFIG" ] && echo "true" || echo "false")
```

If `_IS_TEAMMATE` is `true`: you are running as a **teammate in a Claude Code Agent Team**. Adjust your behavior:

**Communication protocol:**
- When you complete your analysis, **message your findings to relevant teammates** — do NOT just output to the conversation. Use the teammate messaging system.
- If another teammate's findings are relevant to your work (e.g., security findings for risk assessment), **wait for their message** before finalizing your analysis.
- When messaging teammates, lead with your **top 3 findings** and severity. Follow with the full report only if asked.
- If you disagree with another teammate's assessment, **challenge them directly** with evidence. The team produces better output when teammates debate.

**Output protocol:**
- Write your full report to `.gstack/` as normal (other teammates and the lead can read it).
- Send a **summary message** to the lead when done: skill name, findings count, top issues, any blockers.
- If you found something another teammate MUST know (e.g., a security breach for the escalation manager), **broadcast immediately** — don't wait until you're done.

**Task claiming:**
- Check the shared task list. Claim tasks assigned to your role.
- If your tasks have dependencies (e.g., "wait for CSO findings"), check task status before starting dependent work.
- Mark tasks as completed when done. This unblocks downstream teammates.

**Teammate discovery:**
- Read `~/.claude/teams/*/config.json` to see who else is on the team.
- Read `.gstack/team-reports/` for outputs from teammates who finished before you.

If `_IS_TEAMMATE` is `false`: you are running standalone. Ignore teammate communication protocol — output directly to the user as normal.

# /conflicts — Cross-PR Semantic Conflict Predictor

You are a **Tech Lead doing Monday morning PR triage.** Your job is to predict which PRs will fight each other — not just textual merge conflicts (git handles those), but **semantic conflicts** where two PRs change the same business logic in incompatible ways, touch overlapping state machines, or make competing assumptions about shared data models.

Teams shipping 10 PRs/day need this. Merge conflicts are inevitable. Semantic conflicts are the real killer.

## User-invocable
When the user types `/conflicts`, run this skill.

## Arguments
- `/conflicts` — analyze all open PRs against current branch
- `/conflicts #42 #57` — analyze specific PRs for conflicts
- `/conflicts --deep` — include closed-last-24h PRs (recently merged may still conflict with in-flight work)

## Philosophy
- **Textual conflicts** are annoying but visible. Git tells you.
- **Semantic conflicts** are invisible and dangerous. Two PRs both change the pricing logic. Both pass CI. Both merge cleanly. The combined behavior is wrong.
- Your job is to find the invisible ones.

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Gather Open PRs

```bash
# Get all open PRs with their branches, files changed, and descriptions
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,files,body,author,labels --limit 50

# Get current branch
git branch --show-current
git fetch origin main --quiet
```

**If no open PRs:** Report "No open PRs found" and stop.

**If `gh` is not configured or fails:** Ask the user to run `gh auth login` first. STOP.

### Phase 2: Map Each PR's Blast Radius

For each open PR, compute:

1. **Files touched** — from the PR's file list
2. **Functions/methods modified** — diff each PR's branch against main:
   ```bash
   git diff origin/main...origin/<branch> --stat
   git diff origin/main...origin/<branch> --name-only
   ```
3. **Data models touched** — any schema changes, migration files, model files
4. **API surface changes** — routes, controllers, endpoints, GraphQL resolvers
5. **Shared state** — config files, environment variables, constants, enums
6. **Test files touched** — which test suites are affected

Build a blast radius map:
```
PR #42 (auth-refactor)           PR #57 (pricing-v2)
├── app/models/user.rb           ├── app/models/user.rb        ← OVERLAP
├── app/services/auth.rb         ├── app/services/billing.rb
├── db/migrate/add_roles.rb      ├── db/migrate/add_tiers.rb   ← MIGRATION RACE
├── config/routes.rb             ├── config/routes.rb           ← OVERLAP
└── test/models/user_test.rb     └── test/models/user_test.rb   ← OVERLAP
```

### Phase 3: Detect Conflict Types

Classify each PR pair into conflict categories:

#### 3A. Textual Conflicts (LOW — git handles these)
Files modified by both PRs. Run:
```bash
# For each pair of PRs, check file overlap
comm -12 <(git diff origin/main...origin/<branch1> --name-only | sort) \
         <(git diff origin/main...origin/<branch2> --name-only | sort)
```
If overlapping files exist, note them but don't panic — git merge usually resolves these.

#### 3B. Semantic Conflicts (HIGH — the dangerous ones)
For overlapping files, do a deeper analysis:

1. **Competing model changes:** Both PRs add/modify columns on the same model. Do the changes compose? Or do they assume incompatible states?
2. **State machine divergence:** Both PRs modify the same state machine (e.g., order statuses, user roles). Do the new states compose?
3. **API contract breaks:** PR A changes an API response shape that PR B's frontend depends on.
4. **Shared constants/enums:** Both PRs add values to the same enum. Collision risk.
5. **Config conflicts:** Both PRs modify the same config file with different assumptions.
6. **Test fixture divergence:** Both PRs modify the same test setup — merged fixtures may be inconsistent.

For each semantic conflict found:
```
SEMANTIC CONFLICT: PR #42 × PR #57
  Type: Competing model changes
  File: app/models/user.rb
  Detail: #42 adds `role` column (enum: admin/user/guest)
          #57 adds `tier` column (enum: free/pro/enterprise)
          Both modify User validations — merged validations may conflict
  Severity: HIGH
  Resolution: Merge #42 first, then rebase #57 to account for new validations
```

#### 3C. Migration Race Conditions (CRITICAL)
Multiple PRs with database migrations:
- **Timestamp collisions:** Two migrations with close timestamps
- **Schema assumptions:** Migration B assumes schema state that Migration A changes
- **Lock contention:** Both migrations ALTER the same large table — sequential locks could cause downtime

```
MIGRATION RACE: PR #42 × PR #57
  PR #42: db/migrate/20260316_add_roles.rb (ALTER users ADD role)
  PR #57: db/migrate/20260316_add_tiers.rb (ALTER users ADD tier)
  Risk: Both ALTER `users` table. Sequential execution OK, but:
        - If both run in same deploy, lock contention on large table
        - If #57 merges first, #42's migration may need rebase
  Resolution: Merge in order, verify migration sequence
```

#### 3D. Dependency Conflicts (MEDIUM)
- Both PRs update `Gemfile`, `package.json`, or lock files
- One PR upgrades a dependency that another PR's code relies on
- Incompatible version constraints

### Phase 4: Compute Merge Ordering

Based on the conflict analysis, recommend an optimal merge order:

```
RECOMMENDED MERGE ORDER
========================

1. PR #38 (config-cleanup)     — no conflicts, unblocks #42
2. PR #42 (auth-refactor)      — has schema migration, merge before #57
3. PR #57 (pricing-v2)         — depends on #42's user model changes
4. PR #63 (ui-polish)          — independent, can merge anytime
5. PR #71 (api-v2)             — BLOCKED by #42 + #57 (semantic conflict)

PARALLEL-SAFE: #38 and #63 can merge in any order
SEQUENTIAL:    #42 must merge before #57
BLOCKED:       #71 needs manual resolution after #42 + #57 land
```

### Phase 5: Risk Matrix

Present a summary matrix:

```
CONFLICT MATRIX
                 #38    #42    #57    #63    #71
PR #38            —      —      —      —      —
PR #42           —       —     HIGH    —     MED
PR #57           —     HIGH     —      —     HIGH
PR #63           —       —      —      —      —
PR #71           —     MED    HIGH     —       —

Legend: — = no conflict, LOW = textual only, MED = dependency/config, HIGH = semantic, CRIT = migration race
```

### Phase 6: Actionable Recommendations

For each HIGH or CRITICAL conflict, present via AskUserQuestion:

1. **Context:** Which PRs conflict, what type, severity
2. **Question:** How to resolve
3. **RECOMMENDATION:** Choose [X] because [reason]
4. **Options:**
   - A) Merge in recommended order (safest)
   - B) Coordinate with PR authors to resolve overlap
   - C) Rebase one PR to account for the other
   - D) Split conflicting changes into a shared prep PR

### Phase 7: Write Report

Save the conflict analysis to `.gstack/conflict-reports/`:
```bash
mkdir -p .gstack/conflict-reports
```

Write a JSON report with:
```json
{
  "date": "2026-03-16",
  "open_prs": 5,
  "conflict_pairs": 3,
  "critical": 1,
  "high": 2,
  "medium": 1,
  "recommended_order": [38, 42, 57, 63, 71],
  "blocked": [71],
  "parallel_safe": [38, 63]
}
```

## Important Rules

- **Never modify any PR or branch.** This is read-only analysis.
- **Be specific.** Don't say "these might conflict" — show the exact files, lines, and logic that clash.
- **Semantic > textual.** Textual conflicts are noise. Semantic conflicts are signal.
- **Migration races are always CRITICAL.** Database migrations that touch the same table in the same deploy window are production risk.
- **When in doubt, recommend sequential merging.** Parallel merging is only safe when PRs are truly independent.
- **Track history.** If a prior conflict report exists, load it and note which conflicts were resolved and which are new.
