## When to Use

Connects to a real iPhone via USB
CoreDevice IPv6 tunnel, reads Swift source to understand every screen, then
runs a vision-driven agent loop: screenshot → analyze → decide → act →
verify → repeat. All interaction happens via HTTP to an embedded
StateServer in the app under test. Optionally exposes the device over
Tailscale so remote agents (OpenClaw, Codex, any HTTP-capable agent) can
run iOS QA from anywhere without touching the hardware.
Use when asked to "ios qa", "test my iPhone app", "find bugs on the device",
or "qa the iOS app".

Voice triggers (speech-to-text aliases): "iOS quality check", "test the iPhone app", "run iOS QA".

## Preamble

_Replaces the gstack `gstack-skill-start` preamble. In Hermes, use `session_search` to recover prior context, then proceed._

## Decision-Brief Format

_Adapted from gstack's Claude Code AskUserQuestion spec. Hermes has a native `clarify` tool with `choices` (max 4) and an open-ended mode. Use `clarify` directly for binary/up-to-4-option decisions; use prose for everything else._

## Artifacts Sync

_Replaces gstack artifacts sync. In Hermes, `session_search` handles cross-session context recovery automatically._

## Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (claude)

The following nudges are tuned for the claude model family. They are
**subordinate** to skill workflow, STOP points, AskUserQuestion gates, plan-mode
safety, and /ship review gates. If a nudge below conflicts with skill instructions,
the skill wins. Treat these as preferences, not rules.

**Todo-list discipline.** When working through a multi-step plan, mark each task
complete individually as you finish it. Do not batch-complete at the end. If a task
turns out to be unnecessary, mark it skipped with a one-line reason.

**Think before heavy actions.** For complex operations (refactors, migrations,
non-trivial new features), briefly state your approach before executing. This lets
the user course-correct cheaply instead of mid-flight.

**Dedicated tools over Bash.** Prefer Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep over shell
equivalents (cat, sed, find, grep). The dedicated tools are cheaper and clearer.

## Voice

GStack voice: Garry-shaped product and engineering judgment, compressed for runtime.

- Lead with the point. Say what it does, why it matters, and what changes for the builder.
- Be concrete. Name files, functions, line numbers, commands, outputs, evals, and real numbers.
- Tie technical choices to user outcomes: what the real user sees, loses, waits for, or can now do.
- Be direct about quality. Bugs matter. Edge cases matter. Fix the whole thing, not the demo path.
- Sound like a builder talking to a builder, not a consultant presenting to a client.
- Never corporate, academic, PR, or hype. Avoid filler, throat-clearing, generic optimism, and founder cosplay.
- No em dashes. No AI vocabulary: delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, multifaceted, furthermore, moreover, additionally, pivotal, landscape, tapestry, underscore, foster, showcase, intricate, vibrant, fundamental, significant.
- The user has context you do not: domain knowledge, timing, relationships, taste. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision. The user decides.

Good: "auth.ts:47 returns undefined when the session cookie expires. Users hit a white screen. Fix: add a null check and redirect to /login. Two lines."
Bad: "I've identified a potential issue in the authentication flow that may cause problems under certain conditions."

## Context Recovery

At session start or after compaction, recover recent project context.

```bash
eval "$(~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool 2>/dev/null)"
_PROJ="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}"
if [ -d "$_PROJ" ]; then
  echo "--- RECENT ARTIFACTS ---"
  find "$_PROJ/ceo-plans" "$_PROJ/checkpoints" -type f -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | xargs -r ls -t 2>/dev/null | head -3
  [ -f "$_PROJ/${BRANCH:-unknown}-reviews.jsonl" ] && echo "REVIEWS: $(wc -l < "$_PROJ/${BRANCH:-unknown}-reviews.jsonl" | tr -d ' ') entries"
  [ -f "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" ] && tail -5 "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl"
  if [ -f "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" ]; then
    _LAST=$(grep "\"branch\":\"${_BRANCH}\"" "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | grep '"event":"completed"' | tail -1)
    [ -n "$_LAST" ] && echo "LAST_SESSION: $_LAST"
    _RECENT_SKILLS=$(grep "\"branch\":\"${_BRANCH}\"" "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | grep '"event":"completed"' | tail -3 | grep -o '"skill":"[^"]*"' | sed 's/"skill":"//;s/"//' | tr '\n' ',')
    [ -n "$_RECENT_SKILLS" ] && echo "RECENT_PATTERN: $_RECENT_SKILLS"
  fi
  _LATEST_CP=$(find "$_PROJ/checkpoints" -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | xargs -r ls -t 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  [ -n "$_LATEST_CP" ] && echo "LATEST_CHECKPOINT: $_LATEST_CP"
  if [ -f "$_PROJ/decisions.active.json" ]; then
    echo "--- ACTIVE DECISIONS (recent, scope-relevant) ---"
    ~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool --recent 5 2>/dev/null
    echo "--- END DECISIONS ---"
  fi
  echo "--- END ARTIFACTS ---"
fi
```

If artifacts are listed, read the newest useful one. If `LAST_SESSION` or `LATEST_CHECKPOINT` appears, give a 2-sentence welcome back summary. If `RECENT_PATTERN` clearly implies a next skill, suggest it once.

**Cross-session decisions.** If `ACTIVE DECISIONS` are listed, treat them as prior settled calls with their rationale — do not silently re-litigate them; if you're about to reverse one, say so explicitly. Reach for `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool` whenever a question touches a past decision ("what did we decide / why / did we try"). When you or the user make a DURABLE decision (architecture, scope, tool/vendor choice, or a reversal) — NOT a turn-level or trivial choice — log it with `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# memory tool` (`--supersede <id>` for a reversal). Reliable and local; gbrain not required.

## Writing Style (skip entirely if `EXPLAIN_LEVEL: terse` appears in the preamble echo OR the user's current message explicitly requests terse / no-explanations output)

Applies to AskUserQuestion, user replies, and findings. AskUserQuestion Format is structure; this is prose quality.

- Gloss curated jargon on first use per skill invocation, even if the user pasted the term.
- Frame questions in outcome terms: what pain is avoided, what capability unlocks, what user experience changes.
- Use short sentences, concrete nouns, active voice.
- Close decisions with user impact: what the user sees, waits for, loses, or gains.
- User-turn override wins: if the current message asks for terse / no explanations / just the answer, skip this section.
- Terse mode (EXPLAIN_LEVEL: terse): no glosses, no outcome-framing layer, shorter responses.

Curated jargon list lives at `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/scripts/jargon-list.json` (80+ terms). On the first jargon term you encounter this session, Read that file once; treat the `terms` array as the canonical list. The list is repo-owned and may grow between releases.


## Completeness Principle — Boil the Ocean

AI makes completeness cheap, so the complete thing is the goal. Recommend full coverage (tests, edge cases, error paths) — boil the ocean one lake at a time. The only thing out of scope is genuinely unrelated work (rewrites, multi-quarter migrations); flag that as separate scope, never as an excuse for a shortcut.

When options differ in coverage, include `Completeness: X/10` (10 = all edge cases, 7 = happy path, 3 = shortcut). When options differ in kind, write: `Note: options differ in kind, not coverage — no completeness score.` Do not fabricate scores.

## Confusion Protocol

For high-stakes ambiguity (architecture, data model, destructive scope, missing context), STOP. Name it in one sentence, present 2-3 options with tradeoffs, and ask. Do not use for routine coding or obvious changes.

## Claimed Limitations Need Evidence

A claimed limitation or requirement ("the API can't do this", "X requires a credential", "that's impossible on this platform") is a material claim. State one only with the verbatim error, the documented statement, or a live probe in hand — pattern-matching a failure to a familiar story is not evidence. When a cheap probe settles the question, run it BEFORE asking the user anything or declaring a step blocked.

## Repo Ownership — See Something, Say Something

`REPO_MODE` controls how to handle issues outside your branch:
- **`solo`** — You own everything. Investigate and offer to fix proactively.
- **`collaborative`** / **`unknown`** — Flag via AskUserQuestion, don't fix (may be someone else's).

Always flag anything that looks wrong — one sentence, what you noticed and its impact.

## Search Before Building

Before building anything unfamiliar, **search first.** See `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/ETHOS.md`.
- **Layer 1** (tried and true) — don't reinvent. **Layer 2** (new and popular) — scrutinize. **Layer 3** (first principles) — prize above all.

**Eureka:** When first-principles reasoning contradicts conventional wisdom, name it and log:
```bash
jq -n --arg ts "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" --arg skill "SKILL_NAME" --arg branch "$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null)" --arg insight "ONE_LINE_SUMMARY" '{ts:$ts,skill:$skill,branch:$branch,insight:$insight}' >> ~/.hermes/gstack/analytics/eureka.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — completed with evidence.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — completed, but list concerns.
- **BLOCKED** — cannot proceed; state blocker and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — missing info; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate after 3 failed attempts, uncertain security-sensitive changes, or scope you cannot verify. Format: `STATUS`, `REASON`, `ATTEMPTED`, `RECOMMENDATION`.

## Operational Self-Improvement

_Replaces gstack `gstack-learnings-log`. In Hermes, durable learnings are saved via the `memory` tool, and reusable workflows become `skill_manage` entries._

## Telemetry

_Replaces `gstack-skill-end`. In Hermes, log durable facts to `memory` and continue. The Hermes gateway handles cross-session metrics._

```

The iOS app's `StateServer` binds loopback only (`::1` + `127.0.0.1`). Tailnet
ingress is exclusively the Mac daemon's job. The daemon validates Tailscale
identities via the local `tailscaled` socket and mints short-lived session
tokens (default 1h) for remote agents.

## Prerequisites

- macOS (the daemon uses `devicectl` from Xcode).
- iPhone connected via USB, paired and trusted.
- Xcode + Swift toolchain installed (`swift --version` reports >= 5.9).
- App source available on disk, with at least one `@Observable` class.
- For remote-control mode: Tailscale installed and the user logged in.

## Phase 0: Session warm-start (optional)

If `~/.hermes/gstack/ios-qa-session.json` exists and the device is still connected,
skip Phase 1-2 and jump to Phase 3. The session cache holds the rotated token,
UDID, tunnel address, and accessor hash. Invalidate the cache when:

- The user passes `--cold` to force a full bootstrap.
- The accessor hash mismatch is detected on first state query.
- The daemon reports the cached UDID is no longer connected.

```bash
SESSION="$HOME/.gstack/ios-qa-session.json"
if [ -f "$SESSION" ] && [ "$COLD" != "1" ]; then
  CACHED_UDID=$(python3 -c "import json,os; d=json.load(open(os.path.expanduser('$SESSION'))); print(d['udid'])")
  CACHED_PORT=$(python3 -c "import json,os; d=json.load(open(os.path.expanduser('$SESSION'))); print(d['daemon_port'])")
  if curl -sf "http://127.0.0.1:$CACHED_PORT/healthz" > /dev/null; then
    echo "Warm start: daemon alive, device $CACHED_UDID connected"
  fi
fi
```

## Phase 1: Read source, plan codegen

1. Before changing the app or replacing an installed build, verify that the
   bridge is compatible with the project:
   - The generator currently supports file-scope `@Observable` classes only;
     `ObservableObject`, `@StateObject`, and other observation models do not
     produce accessors.
   - The documented dependency wiring assumes a SwiftPM app manifest. For an
     `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace`, do not invent package or target wiring.
   If either requirement is unmet, stop the bridge bootstrap without modifying
   the app. Preserve any installed production or TestFlight build. Prefer an
   existing real-device XCUITest harness; when a separate QA build is needed,
   use an isolated bundle identifier and non-production entitlements so it can
   coexist with the production app. Report fixture-driven state, provider UI,
   and actual external-provider success as distinct evidence tiers.
2. Walk the app source (passed as `--source <dir>`) and identify all `@Observable`
   classes. Note any property immediately preceded by the generator marker
   comment `// @Snapshotable` — those are the snapshot-eligible fields. The
   marker is a comment so it composes with the `@Observable` macro. Each
   marked field must belong to a file-scope observable class and be a writable
   instance `var` with an explicit type and an internal or public setter.
   Snapshot types are JSON-native scalars (`String`, `Bool`, integer widths,
   `Float`, `Double`, `CGFloat`), arrays, String-keyed dictionaries, and their
   Optional compositions. Keys must be unique across observable classes.
   Codegen stops with a source diagnostic instead of emitting a broken or
   lossy harness when any of these constraints is violated.
3. Show the user the accessor list and ask whether to install the DebugBridge
   SPM dependency into their `Package.swift` (one AskUserQuestion).

## Phase 2: Bootstrap the device bridge

1. Generate the canonical local bridge package, typed accessors, and installed
   version marker with one deterministic command:
   ```bash
   ~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/# (iOS QA not available on Hermes) \
     --app-source "<source-dir>" \
     --bridge-dir "<source-dir>/DebugBridge"
   ```
   The regenerator also removes the explicit obsolete flat-file set created by
   older ios-sync versions, preventing a stale second harness from remaining
   in the app target.
2. Add the generated `DebugBridge` local SPM dependency to the app's
   `Package.swift`. The package
   ships three Debug-config-only library products:
   - `DebugBridgeCore` (Swift, cross-platform) — StateServer + bridge protocols.
   - `DebugBridgeTouch` (Objective-C, iOS-only) — KIF-derived in-process touch
     synthesis with iOS 18+ `_UIHitTestContext` SwiftUI hit-testing.
   - `DebugBridgeUI` (Swift, iOS-only) — Screenshot / Elements / Mutation
     bridge implementations.
   The app target depends on `DebugBridgeUI` with `.when(configuration: .debug)`
   (transitively pulls in Core + Touch). Release builds refuse to link these
   targets.
3. Wire the bridges from the `@main` App init, gated on `#if DEBUG`:
   ```swift
   #if DEBUG
   import DebugBridgeCore
   #if canImport(UIKit)
   import DebugBridgeUI
   // Install resolvers before StateServer opens its listener.
   DebugBridgeUIWiring.installAll()
   #endif
   // Replace AppState/AppStateAccessor with the type discovered in Phase 1.
   DebugBridgeManager.shared.start(
       appState: appState,
       register: AppStateAccessor.register
   )
   #endif
   ```
4. Build + deploy to the device with `xcodebuild -scheme <SchemeName>
   -destination 'platform=iOS,id=<UDID>' build install`.
5. Launch via `devicectl device process launch --device <UDID> --console <bundle-id>`.
   Capture the boot token printed to `os_log` on first run.
6. Spawn the Mac-side daemon (on-demand) — `gstack-ios-qa-daemon`. Daemon
   acquires an exclusive flock on `~/.hermes/gstack/ios-qa-daemon.pid`. If another
   daemon is alive, the second invocation discovers its port and connects.
7. Daemon immediately calls `POST /auth/rotate` on the iOS StateServer with a
   fresh in-memory-only token. The boot token becomes useless ~5s later.
   Anything scraping `os_log` past this point sees a dead credential.
   If a fresh daemon finds the app running after another daemon consumed that
   one-use token, it verifies the bundle owner, relaunches the target once,
   waits for the new token, verifies ownership again, and then rotates.

## Phase 3: Vision-driven agent loop

Each iteration:

1. `GET /screenshot` (via daemon) → save PNG.
2. `GET /elements` → accessibility tree.
3. `GET /state/snapshot` (only `// @Snapshotable` fields) → current state.
4. Decide next action based on what's on the screen vs the test goal.
5. `POST /session/acquire` to grab the device lock.
6. Execute `POST /tap`, `/swipe`, `/type`, or `POST /state/<key>` write.
7. Re-screenshot; compare; record finding if buggy.
8. `POST /session/release` once the iteration is done.

Each authenticated mutating request through the tailnet listener (if remote
mode is active) writes an audit row to
`~/.hermes/gstack/security/ios-qa-audit.jsonl`.

## Modes

**Local-USB mode (default).** Daemon binds loopback only; no Tailscale
required. The spawning skill gets full-surface access. Best for solo
development.

**Tailnet mode (`--tailnet`).** Daemon additionally binds the Tailscale
interface (never `0.0.0.0`). Requires `tailscaled` to be running locally and
the daemon to be able to read `/var/run/tailscale.sock`. Fails closed if the
socket is missing, permission-denied, or returns an unparseable WhoIs
response. Remote agents hit `POST /auth/mint` over tailnet, daemon
canonicalizes identity via WhoIs, checks the allowlist file, mints a
session token. See `ios-qa/docs/tailscale-acl-example.md`.

**Capability tiers (tailnet mode).** Minted tokens default to `interact`
(taps, swipes, types). Higher tiers require explicit owner mint:

- **observe:** `/screenshot`, `/elements`, `GET /state/*`, `/healthz`,
  `/session/heartbeat`.
- **interact:** observe + `/tap`, `/swipe`, `/type`.
- **mutate:** interact + `POST /state/<key>`.
- **restore:** mutate + `POST /state/restore`.

Owner mints via `# (iOS QA not available on Hermes) --remote <identity> --capability <tier>`
on the Mac. Self-service mint over tailnet only succeeds for already-allowlisted
identities.

**Recording mode (`--recording`).** DebugOverlay renders a small diagonal
"AGENT DEMO" watermark in a corner so screencasts are unambiguous about the
device being agent-driven.

## Demo mode

If the user says "demo", "demo mode", "show me", or "I want to see it
working", run in **DEMO MODE**. This changes how the agent interacts with
the app:

**DEMO MODE OVERRIDES ALL OTHER RULES.** When demo mode is active, the
agent MUST drive every action through visible UI (`/tap`, `/swipe`, `/type`)
and NEVER use `POST /state/*` writes to skip steps. Viewers see the agent
type every key, tap every button. The on-device DebugOverlay attribution
chip shows "Driven by Claude Code (demo)" or the remote agent identity.

In demo mode, the screencap rate is bumped to 4fps so the recording feels
live.

## Failure modes + recovery

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `curl: connection refused` to daemon | daemon crashed | Re-run `/ios-qa`; spawn-race lock will fail closed |
| `403 identity_not_allowed` from `/auth/mint` | identity missing from allowlist | Run `# (iOS QA not available on Hermes) --remote <identity>` on the Mac |
| `409 schema_mismatch` on `/state/restore` | snapshot from older app build | Discard the snapshot; re-capture |
| `503 device_disconnected` from proxy | USB route dropped or app relaunched | Daemon invalidates the stale tunnel and retries one fresh bootstrap; reconnect/unlock the iPhone if it persists |
| `429 rate_limited` from `/auth/mint` | >10 mints/min from one identity | Wait 60s; check audit log for anomalies |
| `413 body_too_large` on `/state/restore` | snapshot >1MB | Increase `--max-body` or trim snapshot |

## Cleanup

Use `/ios-clean` to remove the DebugBridge SPM dependency and all `#if DEBUG`
wiring before a Release build. This is a convenience flow; the structural
Release-build guard (Package.swift `.when(configuration: .debug)` + CI
`swift build -c release` check) is the safety-critical path.
