## When to Use

Code review: independent diff review via
codex review with pass/fail gate. Challenge: adversarial mode that tries to break
your code. Consult: ask codex anything with session continuity for follow-ups.
The "200 IQ autistic developer" second opinion. Use when asked to "codex review",
"codex challenge", "ask codex", "second opinion", or "consult codex".

Voice triggers (speech-to-text aliases): "code x", "code ex", "get another opinion".

## Preamble

_Replaces the gstack `gstack-skill-start` preamble. In Hermes, use `session_search` to recover prior context, then proceed._

## Decision-Brief Format

_Adapted from gstack's Claude Code AskUserQuestion spec. Hermes has a native `clarify` tool with `choices` (max 4) and an open-ended mode. Use `clarify` directly for binary/up-to-4-option decisions; use prose for everything else._

## Artifacts Sync

_Replaces gstack artifacts sync. In Hermes, `session_search` handles cross-session context recovery automatically._

## Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (claude)

The following nudges are tuned for the claude model family. They are
**subordinate** to skill workflow, STOP points, AskUserQuestion gates, plan-mode
safety, and /ship review gates. If a nudge below conflicts with skill instructions,
the skill wins. Treat these as preferences, not rules.

**Todo-list discipline.** When working through a multi-step plan, mark each task
complete individually as you finish it. Do not batch-complete at the end. If a task
turns out to be unnecessary, mark it skipped with a one-line reason.

**Think before heavy actions.** For complex operations (refactors, migrations,
non-trivial new features), briefly state your approach before executing. This lets
the user course-correct cheaply instead of mid-flight.

**Dedicated tools over Bash.** Prefer Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep over shell
equivalents (cat, sed, find, grep). The dedicated tools are cheaper and clearer.

## Voice

GStack voice: Garry-shaped product and engineering judgment, compressed for runtime.

- Lead with the point. Say what it does, why it matters, and what changes for the builder.
- Be concrete. Name files, functions, line numbers, commands, outputs, evals, and real numbers.
- Tie technical choices to user outcomes: what the real user sees, loses, waits for, or can now do.
- Be direct about quality. Bugs matter. Edge cases matter. Fix the whole thing, not the demo path.
- Sound like a builder talking to a builder, not a consultant presenting to a client.
- Never corporate, academic, PR, or hype. Avoid filler, throat-clearing, generic optimism, and founder cosplay.
- No em dashes. No AI vocabulary: delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, multifaceted, furthermore, moreover, additionally, pivotal, landscape, tapestry, underscore, foster, showcase, intricate, vibrant, fundamental, significant.
- The user has context you do not: domain knowledge, timing, relationships, taste. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision. The user decides.

Good: "auth.ts:47 returns undefined when the session cookie expires. Users hit a white screen. Fix: add a null check and redirect to /login. Two lines."
Bad: "I've identified a potential issue in the authentication flow that may cause problems under certain conditions."

## Context Recovery

At session start or after compaction, recover recent project context.

```bash
eval "$(~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool 2>/dev/null)"
_PROJ="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}"
if [ -d "$_PROJ" ]; then
  echo "--- RECENT ARTIFACTS ---"
  find "$_PROJ/ceo-plans" "$_PROJ/checkpoints" -type f -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | xargs -r ls -t 2>/dev/null | head -3
  [ -f "$_PROJ/${BRANCH:-unknown}-reviews.jsonl" ] && echo "REVIEWS: $(wc -l < "$_PROJ/${BRANCH:-unknown}-reviews.jsonl" | tr -d ' ') entries"
  [ -f "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" ] && tail -5 "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl"
  if [ -f "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" ]; then
    _LAST=$(grep "\"branch\":\"${_BRANCH}\"" "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | grep '"event":"completed"' | tail -1)
    [ -n "$_LAST" ] && echo "LAST_SESSION: $_LAST"
    _RECENT_SKILLS=$(grep "\"branch\":\"${_BRANCH}\"" "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | grep '"event":"completed"' | tail -3 | grep -o '"skill":"[^"]*"' | sed 's/"skill":"//;s/"//' | tr '\n' ',')
    [ -n "$_RECENT_SKILLS" ] && echo "RECENT_PATTERN: $_RECENT_SKILLS"
  fi
  _LATEST_CP=$(find "$_PROJ/checkpoints" -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | xargs -r ls -t 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  [ -n "$_LATEST_CP" ] && echo "LATEST_CHECKPOINT: $_LATEST_CP"
  if [ -f "$_PROJ/decisions.active.json" ]; then
    echo "--- ACTIVE DECISIONS (recent, scope-relevant) ---"
    ~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool --recent 5 2>/dev/null
    echo "--- END DECISIONS ---"
  fi
  echo "--- END ARTIFACTS ---"
fi
```

If artifacts are listed, read the newest useful one. If `LAST_SESSION` or `LATEST_CHECKPOINT` appears, give a 2-sentence welcome back summary. If `RECENT_PATTERN` clearly implies a next skill, suggest it once.

**Cross-session decisions.** If `ACTIVE DECISIONS` are listed, treat them as prior settled calls with their rationale — do not silently re-litigate them; if you're about to reverse one, say so explicitly. Reach for `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool` whenever a question touches a past decision ("what did we decide / why / did we try"). When you or the user make a DURABLE decision (architecture, scope, tool/vendor choice, or a reversal) — NOT a turn-level or trivial choice — log it with `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# memory tool` (`--supersede <id>` for a reversal). Reliable and local; gbrain not required.

## Writing Style (skip entirely if `EXPLAIN_LEVEL: terse` appears in the preamble echo OR the user's current message explicitly requests terse / no-explanations output)

Applies to AskUserQuestion, user replies, and findings. AskUserQuestion Format is structure; this is prose quality.

- Gloss curated jargon on first use per skill invocation, even if the user pasted the term.
- Frame questions in outcome terms: what pain is avoided, what capability unlocks, what user experience changes.
- Use short sentences, concrete nouns, active voice.
- Close decisions with user impact: what the user sees, waits for, loses, or gains.
- User-turn override wins: if the current message asks for terse / no explanations / just the answer, skip this section.
- Terse mode (EXPLAIN_LEVEL: terse): no glosses, no outcome-framing layer, shorter responses.

Curated jargon list lives at `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/scripts/jargon-list.json` (80+ terms). On the first jargon term you encounter this session, Read that file once; treat the `terms` array as the canonical list. The list is repo-owned and may grow between releases.


## Completeness Principle — Boil the Ocean

AI makes completeness cheap, so the complete thing is the goal. Recommend full coverage (tests, edge cases, error paths) — boil the ocean one lake at a time. The only thing out of scope is genuinely unrelated work (rewrites, multi-quarter migrations); flag that as separate scope, never as an excuse for a shortcut.

When options differ in coverage, include `Completeness: X/10` (10 = all edge cases, 7 = happy path, 3 = shortcut). When options differ in kind, write: `Note: options differ in kind, not coverage — no completeness score.` Do not fabricate scores.

## Confusion Protocol

For high-stakes ambiguity (architecture, data model, destructive scope, missing context), STOP. Name it in one sentence, present 2-3 options with tradeoffs, and ask. Do not use for routine coding or obvious changes.

## Claimed Limitations Need Evidence

A claimed limitation or requirement ("the API can't do this", "X requires a credential", "that's impossible on this platform") is a material claim. State one only with the verbatim error, the documented statement, or a live probe in hand — pattern-matching a failure to a familiar story is not evidence. When a cheap probe settles the question, run it BEFORE asking the user anything or declaring a step blocked.

## Repo Ownership — See Something, Say Something

`REPO_MODE` controls how to handle issues outside your branch:
- **`solo`** — You own everything. Investigate and offer to fix proactively.
- **`collaborative`** / **`unknown`** — Flag via AskUserQuestion, don't fix (may be someone else's).

Always flag anything that looks wrong — one sentence, what you noticed and its impact.

## Search Before Building

Before building anything unfamiliar, **search first.** See `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/ETHOS.md`.
- **Layer 1** (tried and true) — don't reinvent. **Layer 2** (new and popular) — scrutinize. **Layer 3** (first principles) — prize above all.

**Eureka:** When first-principles reasoning contradicts conventional wisdom, name it and log:
```bash
jq -n --arg ts "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" --arg skill "SKILL_NAME" --arg branch "$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null)" --arg insight "ONE_LINE_SUMMARY" '{ts:$ts,skill:$skill,branch:$branch,insight:$insight}' >> ~/.hermes/gstack/analytics/eureka.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — completed with evidence.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — completed, but list concerns.
- **BLOCKED** — cannot proceed; state blocker and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — missing info; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate after 3 failed attempts, uncertain security-sensitive changes, or scope you cannot verify. Format: `STATUS`, `REASON`, `ATTEMPTED`, `RECOMMENDATION`.

## Operational Self-Improvement

_Replaces gstack `gstack-learnings-log`. In Hermes, durable learnings are saved via the `memory` tool, and reusable workflows become `skill_manage` entries._

## Telemetry

_Replaces `gstack-skill-end`. In Hermes, log durable facts to `memory` and continue. The Hermes gateway handles cross-session metrics._

## Step 0: Detect platform and base branch

First, detect the git hosting platform from the remote URL:

```bash
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null
```

- If the URL contains "github.com" → platform is **GitHub**
- If the URL contains "gitlab" → platform is **GitLab**
- Otherwise, check CLI availability:
  - `gh auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitHub** (covers GitHub Enterprise)
  - `glab auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitLab** (covers self-hosted)
  - Neither → **unknown** (use git-native commands only)

Determine which branch this PR/MR targets, or the repo's default branch if no
PR/MR exists. Use the result as "the base branch" in all subsequent steps.

**If GitHub:**
1. `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName` — if succeeds, use it
2. `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name` — if succeeds, use it

**If GitLab:**
1. `glab mr view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `target_branch` field — if succeeds, use it
2. `glab repo view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `default_branch` field — if succeeds, use it

**Git-native fallback (if unknown platform, or CLI commands fail):**
1. `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'`
2. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/main 2>/dev/null` → use `main`
3. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/master 2>/dev/null` → use `master`

If all fail, fall back to `main`.

Print the detected base branch name. In every subsequent `git diff`, `git log`,
`git fetch`, `git merge`, and PR/MR creation command, substitute the detected
branch name wherever the instructions say "the base branch" or `<default>`.

# /codex — Multi-AI Second Opinion

You are running the `/codex` skill. This wraps the OpenAI Codex CLI to get an independent,
brutally honest second opinion from a different AI system.

Codex is the "200 IQ autistic developer" — direct, terse, technically precise, challenges
assumptions, catches things you might miss. Present its output faithfully, not summarized.

---

## Section index — Read each section when its situation applies

This skill is a decision-tree skeleton. The steps below point to on-demand
sections. Read a section in full before doing its step; do not work from memory.

| When | Read this section |
|------|-------------------|
| running Review mode (Step 2A) — the Step 1 dispatch chose review (`/codex review`, or the user picked "Review the diff") | `sections/review-mode.md` |
| running Challenge mode (Step 2B) — the Step 1 dispatch chose adversarial challenge (`/codex challenge`, or the user picked "Challenge the diff") | `sections/challenge-mode.md` |
| running Consult mode (Step 2C) — the Step 1 dispatch chose consult (a free-form question, a plan review, or a session follow-up) | `sections/consult-mode.md` |

---

## Step 0.4: Check codex binary

```bash
CODEX_BIN=$(command -v codex || echo "")
[ -z "$CODEX_BIN" ] && echo "NOT_FOUND" || echo "FOUND: $CODEX_BIN"
```

If `NOT_FOUND`: stop and tell the user:
"Codex CLI not found. Install it: `npm install -g @openai/codex` or see https://github.com/openai/codex"

If `NOT_FOUND`, also log the event:
```bash
_TEL=$(~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config get telemetry 2>/dev/null || echo off)
source ~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-codex-probe 2>/dev/null && _gstack_codex_log_event "codex_cli_missing" 2>/dev/null || true
```

---

## Step 0.5: Auth probe + model probe + version check

Before building expensive prompts, verify Codex has valid auth, that the account
can actually USE its configured model, AND the installed CLI version isn't in the
known-bad list. Sourcing `gstack-codex-probe` loads the shared helpers that both
`/codex` and `/autoplan` use.

```bash
_TEL=$(~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config get telemetry 2>/dev/null || echo off)
source ~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-codex-probe

# Running-under-Codex presence probe (#2519): a live Codex session exports
# CODEX_THREAD_ID / CODEX_SANDBOX into every shell it spawns.
if [ "${GSTACK_FORCE_CODEX_REVIEW:-0}" != "1" ] && { [ -n "${CODEX_THREAD_ID:-}" ] || [ -n "${CODEX_SANDBOX:-}" ]; }; then
  echo "UNDER_CODEX"
elif ! _gstack_codex_auth_probe >/dev/null; then
  _gstack_codex_log_event "codex_auth_failed"
  echo "AUTH_FAILED"
else
  _gstack_codex_model_probe   # ~10s round trip on first run, cached 1h (#2477)
fi
_gstack_codex_version_check   # warns if known-bad, non-blocking
```

If the output contains `UNDER_CODEX`, stop with exactly one line:
"[running under Codex — /codex would nest the same model at multiplied token
cost; skipped. Set `GSTACK_FORCE_CODEX_REVIEW=1` to force.]" The whole value
of this skill is a SECOND model's opinion; inside a Codex host it is the same
model reviewing itself, and nested spawns have burned 15M tokens in one
/review (#2519).

If the output contains `AUTH_FAILED`, stop and tell the user:
"No Codex authentication found. Run `codex login` or set `$CODEX_API_KEY` / `$OPENAI_API_KEY`, then re-run this skill."

If the output contains `MODEL_UNUSABLE`, stop — auth exists but the account
cannot use the configured model (a stale `model =` pin in
`~/.codex/config.toml` is the usual cause). Relay the probe's HINT lines and
follow the "Model not supported (HTTP 400)" recovery steps in
`## Error Handling` below. Running the modes anyway just burns four
invocations on the same 400 (#2477).

`MODEL_PROBE_INCONCLUSIVE` is non-blocking (timeout/transient network): pass
the warning through and continue.

If the version check printed a `WARN:` line, pass it through to the user verbatim
(non-blocking — Codex may still work, but the user should upgrade).

The probe multi-signal auth logic accepts: `$CODEX_API_KEY` set, `$OPENAI_API_KEY`
set, or `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/auth.json` exists. Avoids false-negatives for
env-auth users (CI, platform engineers) that file-only checks would reject.

**Update the known-bad list** in `bin/gstack-codex-probe` when a new Codex CLI version
regresses. Current entries (`0.120.0`, `0.120.1`, `0.120.2`) trace to the stdin
deadlock fixed in #972.

---

## Step 0.6: Resolve portable roots

Before any mode runs, resolve `$PLAN_ROOT` (where plan files live) and `$TMP_ROOT`
(where ephemeral codex stderr / response captures land) via `# hermes config path`.
This keeps the skill working whether installed as a Claude Code plugin
(`CLAUDE_PLANS_DIR` set), a global `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/` install, or a CI
container where `HOME` may be unset and `/tmp` may be read-only.

```bash
eval "$(~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# hermes config path)"
```

After this, every subsequent bash block in this skill uses `"$PLAN_ROOT"` and
`"$TMP_ROOT"` rather than hardcoded `~/.hermes/plans` or `/tmp/codex-*`.

---

## Step 1: Detect mode

Parse the user's input to determine which mode to run:

1. `/codex review` or `/codex review <instructions>` — **Review mode** (Step 2A)
2. `/codex challenge` or `/codex challenge <focus>` — **Challenge mode** (Step 2B)
3. `/codex` with no arguments — **Auto-detect:**
   - Check for a diff (with fallback if origin isn't available):
     `git diff origin/<base> --stat 2>/dev/null | tail -1 || git diff <base> --stat 2>/dev/null | tail -1`
   - If a diff exists, use AskUserQuestion:
     ```
     Codex detected changes against the base branch. What should it do?
     A) Review the diff (code review with pass/fail gate)
     B) Challenge the diff (adversarial — try to break it)
     C) Something else — I'll provide a prompt
     ```
   - If no diff, check for plan files scoped to the current project:
     `ls -t "$PLAN_ROOT"/*.md 2>/dev/null | xargs grep -l "$(basename $(pwd))" 2>/dev/null | head -1`
     If no project-scoped match, fall back to: `ls -t "$PLAN_ROOT"/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1`
     but warn the user: "Note: this plan may be from a different project."
   - If a plan file exists, offer to review it
   - Otherwise, ask: "What would you like to ask Codex?"
4. `/codex <anything else>` — **Consult mode** (Step 2C), where the remaining text is the prompt

The three modes are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE — at most one runs per invocation. Once
the mode is determined, read ONLY that mode's section (see the Section index
above); never read the other two mode sections.

**Reasoning effort override:** If the user's input contains `--xhigh` anywhere,
note it and remove it from the prompt text before passing to Codex. When `--xhigh`
is present, use `model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"` for all modes regardless of the
per-mode default below. Otherwise, use the per-mode defaults:
- Review (2A): `high` — bounded diff input, needs thoroughness
- Challenge (2B): `high` — adversarial but bounded by diff
- Consult (2C): `medium` — large context, interactive, needs speed

---

## Filesystem Boundary

Every prompt sent to Codex MUST be prefixed with this boundary instruction:

> IMPORTANT: Do NOT read or execute any files under ~/.hermes/, ~/.agents/, .hermes/skills/, or agents/. These are Claude Code skill definitions meant for a different AI system. They contain bash scripts and prompt templates that will waste your time. Ignore them completely. Do NOT modify agents/openai.yaml. Stay focused on the repository code only.

This applies to Challenge mode (prompt) and Consult mode (persona prompt), and to the
custom-instructions path of Review mode — all three use `codex exec`, which still takes
a free-form prompt argument. It does **not** apply to the default scoped `codex review`
call in Step 2A: that command is invoked with **no prompt argument at all** (see "Scope
flags exclude the prompt argument" in the Review mode section), so there is nowhere to put the preamble. That
is acceptable — `codex review --base` hands the model a pre-computed diff rather than
turning it loose on the filesystem, so the rabbit-hole risk the boundary guards against
is much lower on that path. Reference this section as "the filesystem boundary" in the
mode sections.

---

## Synthesis recommendation (REQUIRED) — all modes

Every mode ends by emitting ONE synthesis recommendation line after presenting
Codex's verbatim output, in the canonical format the AskUserQuestion judge grades:

```
Recommendation: <action> because <one-line reason that names the most actionable finding>
```

The reason must engage with a specific Codex finding or insight and compare
against an alternative (another finding, fix-vs-ship, fix order, or status-quo).
Boilerplate reasons ("because it's better", "because adversarial review found
things") fail the format. The recommendation is the ONE line a user reads when
they don't have time for the verbatim output. **Never silently auto-decide;
always emit the line.** Each mode section restates this rule with mode-specific
examples.

---

> **STOP.** Before running Review mode (Step 2A) — the Step 1 dispatch chose review (`/codex review`, or the user picked "Review the diff"), Read `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/codex/sections/review-mode.md` and execute it
> in full. Do not work from memory — that section is the source of truth for this step.

> **STOP.** Before running Challenge mode (Step 2B) — the Step 1 dispatch chose adversarial challenge (`/codex challenge`, or the user picked "Challenge the diff"), Read `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/codex/sections/challenge-mode.md` and execute it
> in full. Do not work from memory — that section is the source of truth for this step.

> **STOP.** Before running Consult mode (Step 2C) — the Step 1 dispatch chose consult (a free-form question, a plan review, or a session follow-up), Read `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/codex/sections/consult-mode.md` and execute it
> in full. Do not work from memory — that section is the source of truth for this step.

## Plan File Review Report

After displaying the Review Readiness Dashboard in conversation output, also update the
**plan file** itself so review status is visible to anyone reading the plan.

### Detect the plan file

1. Check if there is an active plan file in this conversation (the host provides plan file
   paths in system messages — look for plan file references in the conversation context).
2. If not found, skip this section silently — not every review runs in plan mode.

### Generate the report

Read the review log output you already have from the Review Readiness Dashboard step above.
Parse each JSONL entry. Each skill logs different fields:

- **plan-ceo-review**: \`status\`, \`unresolved\`, \`critical_gaps\`, \`mode\`, \`scope_proposed\`, \`scope_accepted\`, \`scope_deferred\`, \`commit\`
  → Findings: "{scope_proposed} proposals, {scope_accepted} accepted, {scope_deferred} deferred"
  → If scope fields are 0 or missing (HOLD/REDUCTION mode): "mode: {mode}, {critical_gaps} critical gaps"
- **plan-eng-review**: \`status\`, \`unresolved\`, \`critical_gaps\`, \`issues_found\`, \`mode\`, \`commit\`
  → Findings: "{issues_found} issues, {critical_gaps} critical gaps"
- **plan-design-review**: \`status\`, \`initial_score\`, \`overall_score\`, \`unresolved\`, \`decisions_made\`, \`commit\`
  → Findings: "score: {initial_score}/10 → {overall_score}/10, {decisions_made} decisions"
- **plan-devex-review**: \`status\`, \`initial_score\`, \`overall_score\`, \`product_type\`, \`tthw_current\`, \`tthw_target\`, \`mode\`, \`persona\`, \`competitive_tier\`, \`unresolved\`, \`commit\`
  → Findings: "score: {initial_score}/10 → {overall_score}/10, TTHW: {tthw_current} → {tthw_target}"
- **devex-review**: \`status\`, \`overall_score\`, \`product_type\`, \`tthw_measured\`, \`dimensions_tested\`, \`dimensions_inferred\`, \`boomerang\`, \`commit\`
  → Findings: "score: {overall_score}/10, TTHW: {tthw_measured}, {dimensions_tested} tested/{dimensions_inferred} inferred"
- **codex-review**: \`status\`, \`gate\`, \`findings\`, \`findings_fixed\`
  → Findings: "{findings} findings, {findings_fixed}/{findings} fixed"

All fields needed for the Findings column are now present in the JSONL entries.
For the review you just completed, you may use richer details from your own Completion
Summary. For prior reviews, use the JSONL fields directly — they contain all required data.

Produce this markdown table:

\`\`\`markdown
## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | \`/plan-ceo-review\` | Scope & strategy | {runs} | {status} | {findings} |
| Codex Review | \`/codex review\` | Independent 2nd opinion | {runs} | {status} | {findings} |
| Eng Review | \`/plan-eng-review\` | Architecture & tests (required) | {runs} | {status} | {findings} |
| Design Review | \`/plan-design-review\` | UI/UX gaps | {runs} | {status} | {findings} |
| DX Review | \`/plan-devex-review\` | Developer experience gaps | {runs} | {status} | {findings} |
\`\`\`

Below the table, add these lines. **CODEX** and **CROSS-MODEL** are optional (omit when
empty); **VERDICT** is always present:

- **CODEX:** (only if codex-review ran) — one-line summary of codex fixes
- **CROSS-MODEL:** (only if both Claude and Codex reviews exist) — overlap analysis
- **VERDICT:** list reviews that are CLEAR (e.g., "CEO + ENG CLEARED — ready to implement").
  If Eng Review is not CLEAR and not skipped globally, append "eng review required".

**Unresolved-decisions status (MANDATORY — never omitted; the report's final non-whitespace
line).** After VERDICT, end the report (content under the \`## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT\`
heading — a bold label, never a new \`## \` heading; exempt from the "omit when empty"
rule) with exactly one: the exact unbolded line \`NO UNRESOLVED DECISIONS\` (a bolded one
does NOT count), OR a \`**UNRESOLVED DECISIONS:**\` header + one bullet per open item
(last bullet = final line; add \`+ N unresolved from prior reviews\` only when N > 0).
This avoids double-counting: list THIS review's open items from context; for prior reviews
sum \`unresolved\` over the latest fresh row per skill (dashboard 7-day window) after you
DROP the current skill's row; emit the sentinel only when both are zero.

### Write to the plan file

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

The report must always be the LAST section of the plan file — never mid-file.
Use a single delete-then-append flow:

1. Read the plan file (Read tool) to see its full current content. Search the read
   output for a \`## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT\` heading anywhere in the file.
2. If found, use the patch tool to DELETE the entire existing section. Match from
   \`## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT\` through either the next \`## \` heading or end of
   file, whichever comes first. Replace with the empty string. This applies
   regardless of where the section currently lives — mid-file deletion is
   intentional, not a special case. If the Edit fails (e.g., concurrent edit
   changed the content), re-read the plan file and retry once.
3. After the delete (or skipped, if no section existed), append the new
   \`## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT\` section at the END of the file. Use the Edit
   tool to match the file's current last paragraph and add the section after it,
   or use write_file to re-emit the whole file with the section at the end.
4. Verify with the read_file tool that \`## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT\` is the last
   \`## \` heading in the file before continuing. If it isn't, repeat steps
   2-3 once.

Do NOT replace the section in place. The "replace mid-file" path is what allowed
prior versions to leave the report mid-file when an older report already lived
there — the user then sees a plan whose review report is not at the bottom and
(correctly) rejects it.

## EXIT PLAN MODE GATE (BLOCKING)

Before calling ExitPlanMode, run this self-check. If any item fails, do the
missing work — do NOT call ExitPlanMode:

1. Read the plan file with the read_file tool (after your most recent write to it).
2. Confirm the LAST `## ` heading in the file is `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT`.
   In-body prose that mentions "outside voice", "codex findings", or similar
   does NOT count — only the structured `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section
   satisfies this check.
3. Confirm the report has a Runs / Status / Findings table and a VERDICT line
   (CODEX / CROSS-MODEL absorbed if applicable).
4. Confirm the report's FINAL non-whitespace line is the unresolved-decisions
   status: the exact unbolded `NO UNRESOLVED DECISIONS`, or a bullet of a final
   `**UNRESOLVED DECISIONS:**` block. BLOCKING, no "if applicable" escape — a
   bolded sentinel, any trailing CODEX/CROSS-MODEL/VERDICT/prose, or a missing
   status each FAILS the gate.
5. If a plan file is in context for this skill invocation: confirm
   `gstack-review-log` was called and `gstack-review-read` was run at least
   once. If no plan file is in context (e.g. `/codex consult` against a
   diff with no plan), this check short-circuits — checks 1-4 already
   short-circuit when no plan file exists.

Failing this gate and calling ExitPlanMode anyway is a contract violation —
the user will see a plan whose review report is missing or stale, and will
(correctly) reject it. Self-deception failure mode to watch for: feeling
"done" after writing review prose into the plan body. The body prose is not
the report. The report is a separate, structured, table-bearing section that
must be the file's terminal heading.

## Model & Reasoning

**Model:** No model is hardcoded — codex uses whatever its current default is (the frontier
agentic coding model). This means as OpenAI ships newer models, /codex automatically
uses them. If the user wants a specific model, pass it through — but the flag differs
by mode (see below).

**Reasoning effort (per-mode defaults):**
- **Review (2A):** `high` — bounded diff input, needs thoroughness but not max tokens
- **Challenge (2B):** `high` — adversarial but bounded by diff size
- **Consult (2C):** `medium` — large context (plans, codebase), interactive, needs speed

`xhigh` uses ~23x more tokens than `high` and causes 50+ minute hangs on large context
tasks (OpenAI issues #8545, #8402, #6931). Users can override with `--xhigh` flag
(e.g., `/codex review --xhigh`) when they want maximum reasoning and are willing to wait.

**Web search:** All codex commands pass `-c 'web_search="cached"'` so `codex exec`
invocations can look up docs and APIs during review. This is OpenAI's cached index —
fast, no extra cost. Unlike the legacy `--enable`-based spelling (deprecated by
codex >=0.144), the `-c` form explicitly overrides any top-level
`web_search` setting in `~/.codex/config.toml`. Note: native `codex review` disables
web search regardless of configuration, so on the default Review path the flag is a
harmless no-op — only exec-based modes actually search.

If the user specifies a model (e.g., `/codex review -m gpt-5.1-codex-max` or
`/codex challenge -m gpt-5.2`), the flag to pass depends on the underlying command:

- **Exec-based modes** (Challenge, Consult, and the custom-instructions Review path)
  run `codex exec`, which takes `-m <model>` — pass it through as-is.
- **Default Review mode** runs `codex review`, which REJECTS `-m`
  (`error: unexpected argument '-m' found`, verified on 0.147.0 — its help lists no
  `-m`/`--model` option). Translate the user's `-m <model>` into the config form:
  `-c model="<model>"`. Same shape as the `--base`-vs-prompt incompatibility above:
  review mode takes its knobs through flags/config, never through extra arguments.

## Cost Estimation

Parse token count from stderr. Codex prints `tokens used\nN` to stderr.

Display as: `Tokens: N`

If token count is not available, display: `Tokens: unknown`

## Error Handling

- **Binary not found:** Detected in Step 0. Stop with install instructions.
- **Auth error:** Codex prints an auth error to stderr. Surface the error:
  "Codex authentication failed. Run `codex login` in your terminal to authenticate via ChatGPT."
- **Timeout (Bash outer gate):** Every Bash gate sits ABOVE its inner wrapper (360s gate
  over the 330s review wrapper; 660s gate over the 600s challenge/consult wrappers), so
  the wrapper's exit-124 path normally fires first with its explicit message. If the Bash
  call itself times out anyway (wrapper unavailable AND codex hung), tell the user:
  "Codex timed out. The prompt may be too large or the API may be slow. Try again or use a smaller scope."
- **Timeout (inner `timeout` wrapper, exit 124):** If the shell `timeout 600` wrapper fires first, the skill's hang-detection block auto-logs a telemetry event + operational learning and prints: "Codex stalled past 10 minutes. Common causes: model API stall, long prompt, network issue. Try re-running. If persistent, split the prompt or check `~/.codex/logs/`." No extra action needed.
- **`the argument '[PROMPT]' cannot be used with '--base <BRANCH>'`:** a prompt argument
  leaked into a scoped `codex review`. This fails instantly, before any API call, so it
  looks like a hang-free "no output" — do not misread it as a model stall. Drop the
  prompt: the scope flags (`--base`, `--commit`, `--uncommitted`) carry the scope on
  their own. If the prompt was custom review instructions, run them through `codex exec`
  instead (Step 2A, custom-instructions path). Do **not** fix it by removing `--base` and
  keeping the prompt — that parses, but silently reviews the uncommitted working tree
  instead of the branch diff.
- **Review says "no changes" on a branch that clearly has changes:** the scope flag is
  missing or wrong. A prompt-only `codex review` defaults to uncommitted changes, so a
  clean working tree reads as an empty review even when `<base>...HEAD` is large. Confirm
  `--base <base>` is actually on the command line.
- **Model not supported (HTTP 400):** stderr shows
  `The '<model>' model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account`
  (a `status: 400` / `invalid_request_error` naming a model). This is an
  entitlement/stale-pin problem, not an auth or network failure, and the auth probe
  cannot catch it. The rejected model comes from the `model = "..."` line in
  `~/.codex/config.toml`. Recovery, in order:
  1. Read `~/.codex/config.toml` and check the `[notice.model_migrations]` table —
     Codex records the intended replacement there (e.g. `"gpt-5.4" = "gpt-5.5"`).
  2. Retry with the replacement model explicitly: exec-based modes (Challenge,
     Consult, custom-instructions Review) take `-m <replacement>`; the default
     Review path uses `codex review`, which REJECTS `-m` — pass
     `-c model="<replacement>"` there instead.
  3. Tell the user the one-line permanent fix: update the `model = ` pin in
     `~/.codex/config.toml`.
  Never present this as a model stall or a PASS — it is a fail-closed gate result.
- **Empty response:** If `$TMPRESP` is empty or doesn't exist, tell the user:
  "Codex returned no response. Check stderr for errors."
- **Session resume failure:** If resume fails, delete the session file and start fresh.

## Important Rules

- **Never modify files.** This skill is read-only. Codex runs in read-only sandbox mode.
- **Present output verbatim.** Do not truncate, summarize, or editorialize Codex's output
  before showing it. Show it in full inside the CODEX SAYS block.
- **Add synthesis after, not instead of.** Any Claude commentary comes after the full output.
- **Bash gate above the wrapper.** Every Bash call to codex sets its `timeout`
  parameter ABOVE the inner `_gstack_codex_timeout_wrapper` budget (Review:
  `timeout: 360000` over the 330s wrapper; Challenge/Consult: `timeout: 660000`
  over the 600s wrappers) so the wrapper fires first with a diagnosable exit 124.
- **No double-reviewing.** If the user already ran `/review`, Codex provides a second
  independent opinion. Do not re-run Claude Code's own review.
- **Detect skill-file rabbit holes.** After receiving Codex output, scan for signs
  that Codex got distracted by skill files: `gstack-config`, `gstack-update-check`,
  `SKILL.md`, or `skills/gstack`. If any of these appear in the output, append a
  warning: "Codex appears to have read gstack skill files instead of reviewing your
  code. Consider retrying."
