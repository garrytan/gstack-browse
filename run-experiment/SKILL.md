## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"
# Learnings count
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || true
_LEARN_FILE="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}/learnings.jsonl"

  _LEARN_COUNT=$(wc -l < "$_LEARN_FILE" 2>/dev/null | tr -d ' ')
  echo "LEARNINGS: $_LEARN_COUNT entries loaded"
  if [ "$_LEARN_COUNT" -gt 5 ] 2>/dev/null; then
    ~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-learnings-search --limit 3 2>/dev/null || true

# Session timeline
_SESSION_ID="$$-$(date +%s)"
_TEL_START=$(date +%s)

```

## Voice

**Tone:** direct, concrete, precise. Sound like a researcher, not a consultant.
Name the file, the function, the exact parameter. No filler.

**Writing rules:**
- No em dashes. Use commas, periods, or "..." instead.
- No AI vocabulary: delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, etc.
- Short paragraphs. Be specific with numbers and file paths.
- End with what to do next.

## Context Recovery

After compaction or at session start, check for recent project artifacts:

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
_PROJ="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}"
if [ -d "$_PROJ" ]; then
  echo "--- RECENT ARTIFACTS ---"
  [ -f "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" ] && tail -5 "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl"
  echo "--- END ARTIFACTS ---"
fi
```

If artifacts are listed, mention recent activity briefly.

## AskUserQuestion — MUST use the tool

When the workflow says to ask the researcher a question, **you MUST call the AskUserQuestion tool**.
Do NOT just print the options as text in the chat. The tool renders clickable options in the UI.

**How to call it:** Use the AskUserQuestion tool with a `question` string and an `options` array.
Include a recommendation in the question text itself.

**Question format:**
1. Re-ground: state the project, branch, and current task (1-2 sentences)
2. Explain the decision in plain English
3. Add `RECOMMENDATION: [option]` with a one-line reason
4. The options array provides the choices — keep them short and actionable

Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes.

## Completeness Principle

AI makes completeness near-free. Always recommend the complete option over shortcuts.

**Effort reference:**

| Task type | Human team | CC+research-stack | Compression |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Boilerplate | 2 days | 15 min | ~100x |
| Parameter sweep | 1 day | 15 min | ~50x |
| Analysis + plots | 4 hours | 15 min | ~20x |
| Hypothesis spec | 2 hours | 5 min | ~25x |

## Repo Ownership

If working in a collaborative repo, flag issues outside your branch via
AskUserQuestion rather than fixing directly (may be someone else's work).

## Search Before Building

Before building anything unfamiliar, **search first.**
- Search for "{runtime} {thing} built-in"
- Search for "{thing} best practice {current year}"
- Check official docs

Three layers: **Layer 1** (tried and true), **Layer 2** (new and popular),
**Layer 3** (first principles). Prize Layer 3 above all.

## Completion Status

When completing a skill workflow, report status:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed with issues to note.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required.

### Operational Learning

Before completing, reflect:
- Did any commands fail unexpectedly?
- Did you discover a project-specific quirk?
- Did something take longer than expected?

If yes, log an operational learning:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-learnings-log '{"skill":"run-experiment","type":"operational","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"source":"observed"}'
```

### Telemetry (run last)

```bash
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-timeline-log '{"skill":"run-experiment","event":"completed","branch":"'$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)'","outcome":"OUTCOME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'"}' 2>/dev/null || true
```

Replace `OUTCOME` with success/error/abort.

# /run-experiment — Generate, Review, Execute

Two-phase workflow: first generate the experiment code per project conventions,
then execute after researcher approval. Never run generated code without approval.

## Input

The user provides either:
- A path to a spec.yaml file (from `/hypothesis`)
- A natural language description (generate a minimal spec inline)

If a spec.yaml path is given:

```bash
cat research/experiments/<slug>/spec.yaml
```

If natural language, extract: parameters, language, what to measure. Then proceed
as if a spec existed.

## Phase A: Code Generation

### Step A1: Read conventions

## Read Project Conventions

Before generating any code, read the project's CLAUDE.md and look for a `## Research conventions` section.

```bash
grep -A 50 "## Research conventions" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_CONVENTIONS"
```

If conventions ARE found, parse them and use them to guide all code generation.
Every generated file must follow these conventions exactly. Convention compliance
is more important than code elegance.

---

If `NO_CONVENTIONS` is printed, the project has no research conventions yet.
**Auto-detect the project and write conventions to CLAUDE.md before continuing.**

**Step 1: Auto-detect project characteristics.**

```bash
echo "=== LANGUAGE DETECTION ==="
if ls *.py **/*.py 2>/dev/null | head -1 >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "DETECTED: python"; fi
if ls *.jl **/*.jl 2>/dev/null | head -1 >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "DETECTED: julia"; fi
if ls *.m **/*.m 2>/dev/null | head -1 >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "DETECTED: matlab"; fi
if ls *.rs **/*.rs 2>/dev/null | head -1 >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "DETECTED: rust"; fi
if ls *.cpp **/*.cpp 2>/dev/null | head -1 >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "DETECTED: cpp"; fi

echo "=== DEPENDENCIES ==="
cat requirements.txt 2>/dev/null || cat pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null | head -30 || cat Project.toml 2>/dev/null | head -20 || echo "NO_DEPS_FILE"

echo "=== TEST COMMAND ==="
if [ -f pyproject.toml ] && grep -q pytest pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null; then echo "DETECTED: pytest"; fi
if [ -f Makefile ] && grep -q "test:" Makefile 2>/dev/null; then grep "test:" Makefile | head -1; fi

echo "=== EXISTING RESEARCH ==="
ls research/ 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_RESEARCH_DIR"
```

**Step 2: Build a conventions draft from the detection results.**

Based on what was detected, draft a `## Research conventions` section. Fill in what was detected, leave reasonable defaults for the rest. Use this format:

```
## Research conventions

language: <detected language, e.g. "python 3.11+">
test_command: <detected or "pytest -x">
compute_backend: local
random_seed_strategy: explicit

preferred_libraries:
  - <libraries from requirements.txt/pyproject.toml>

naming:
  experiments: snake_case
  hypotheses: snake_case

imports:
  - <detected import conventions, e.g. "numpy as np">
```

**Step 3: Present the draft to the researcher for confirmation.**

**You MUST call the AskUserQuestion tool** with these options (do NOT just print the options as text):
- question: Show the drafted conventions and ask "Does this look right? I'll append this to CLAUDE.md."
- options: ["Looks good, save it", "Let me edit it first"]

**Step 4: Append to CLAUDE.md.**

If the researcher approves, append the conventions section to CLAUDE.md using the Edit tool. If CLAUDE.md doesn't exist, create it with the Write tool.

Then continue with the original skill workflow using the newly written conventions.

### Step A2: Read the experiment spec

Parse the spec.yaml to extract:
- Parameter grid (what combinations to sweep)
- Baseline reference (what to compare against)
- Random seeds
- Language and conventions

### Step A3: Generate experiment code

Create `research/experiments/<slug>/run_<slug>.py` (or appropriate extension).

The generated code MUST:

1. **Follow all project conventions** from CLAUDE.md (imports, naming, structure)
2. **Accept parameters from command line or config** — not hardcoded
3. **Include provenance capture** (see spec below)
4. **Write results to a timestamped directory**
5. **Be self-contained** — one file that can be run independently

**Code structure template:**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Experiment: <title from hypothesis>
Spec: research/experiments/<slug>/spec.yaml
Generated by /run-experiment
"""

# --- Imports (per project conventions) ---
import json
import subprocess
import sys
import time
import platform
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from pathlib import Path

# <project-specific imports per CLAUDE.md conventions>

# --- Provenance ---
def capture_provenance(spec_path, parameters, seeds, packages):
    return {
        "git_sha": subprocess.check_output(["git", "rev-parse", "HEAD"]).decode().strip(),
        "git_dirty": bool(subprocess.check_output(["git", "status", "--porcelain"]).decode().strip()),
        "branch": subprocess.check_output(["git", "branch", "--show-current"]).decode().strip(),
        "timestamp": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),
        "wall_clock_seconds": None,
        "packages": packages,
        "random_seeds": seeds,
        "python_version": sys.version.split()[0],
        "platform": f"{sys.platform}-{platform.machine()}",
        "experiment_spec": str(spec_path),
        "parameters": parameters,
    }

# --- Parameters ---
PARAMETERS = {
    # <from spec.yaml>
}
SEEDS = [42, 123, 456]  # <from spec.yaml>

# --- Main experiment ---
def run_experiment(params, seed):
    """Run a single experiment configuration."""
    # <generated experiment logic>
    pass

def main():
    start_time = time.time()
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
    results_dir = Path(f"research/results/<slug>/{timestamp}")
    results_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

    # Capture provenance
    packages = {}  # <detect installed packages>
    prov = capture_provenance(
        "research/experiments/<slug>/spec.yaml",
        PARAMETERS, SEEDS, packages
    )

    # Run parameter sweep
    all_results = []
    for seed in SEEDS:
        for <param_combo> in <param_grid>:
            result = run_experiment(<param_combo>, seed)
            all_results.append(result)

    # Save results
    with open(results_dir / "metrics.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(all_results, f, indent=2)

    # Finalize provenance
    prov["wall_clock_seconds"] = round(time.time() - start_time, 2)
    with open(results_dir / "provenance.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(prov, f, indent=2)

    print(f"Results saved to: {results_dir}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Adapt this template to the specific experiment. Replace placeholders with actual
logic based on the spec and conventions.

### Step A4: APPROVAL GATE

**This step is mandatory. Never skip it.**

Print a summary of the generated code to the chat: file path, what it does,
parameter count, seed count, estimated runtime. Then **call the AskUserQuestion tool**:

- question: "Generated: research/experiments/<slug>/run_<slug>.py. Sweeps <N> parameter combinations x <M> seeds. Estimated runtime: <estimate>. RECOMMENDATION: Run it — the code follows project conventions and provenance is included."
- options: ["Run it", "I want to modify the code first", "Abort"]

If "Run it": Proceed to Phase B.
If "I want to modify the code first": Wait for the researcher to make edits, then re-read the file and proceed.
If "Abort": Stop. Do not execute.

## Phase B: Execution

### Step B1: Check compute backend

Read the `compute_backend` field from CLAUDE.md Research conventions.

- **`local`** (default): Execute via subprocess
- **`slurm`** (future): Generate SLURM job script and submit
- **`cloud`** (future): Generate cloud job config

For local execution:

```bash
cd <project_root>
python research/experiments/<slug>/run_<slug>.py
```

### Step B2: Monitor execution

For long-running experiments, report progress periodically.
If the experiment fails, capture the error and show it to the researcher.

### Step B3: Verify results

After execution completes:

```bash
ls research/results/<slug>/
# Should contain:
# <timestamp>/metrics.json
# <timestamp>/provenance.json
```

Verify:
1. metrics.json exists and is valid JSON
2. provenance.json exists and has all required fields
3. git_sha matches current HEAD

### Step B4: Record to learnings

## Capture Learnings

If you discovered a non-obvious pattern, pitfall, or architectural insight during
this session, log it for future sessions:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-learnings-log '{"skill":"run-experiment","type":"TYPE","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"source":"SOURCE","files":["path/to/relevant/file"]}'
```

**Types:** `pattern` (reusable approach), `pitfall` (what NOT to do), `preference`
(user stated), `architecture` (structural decision), `tool` (library/framework insight),
`operational` (project environment/CLI/workflow knowledge).

**Sources:** `observed` (you found this in the code), `user-stated` (user told you),
`inferred` (AI deduction), `cross-model` (both Claude and Codex agree).

**Confidence:** 1-10. Be honest. An observed pattern you verified in the code is 8-9.
An inference you're not sure about is 4-5. A user preference they explicitly stated is 10.

**files:** Include the specific file paths this learning references. This enables
staleness detection: if those files are later deleted, the learning can be flagged.

**Only log genuine discoveries.** Don't log obvious things. Don't log things the user
already knows. A good test: would this insight save time in a future session? If yes, log it.

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
_LEARN_FILE="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}/learnings.jsonl"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$_LEARN_FILE")"
echo '{"type":"result","slug":"<slug>","success":true,"summary":"<brief_summary>","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' >> "$_LEARN_FILE"
```

### Step B5: Create latest symlink

Create a `latest` symlink so other skills can reliably find the most recent run:

```bash
ln -sfn <timestamp> research/results/<slug>/latest
```

## Output

After completion, tell the researcher:

```
Experiment complete:
  Code:       research/experiments/<slug>/run_<slug>.py
  Results:    research/results/<slug>/<timestamp>/metrics.json
  Provenance: research/results/<slug>/<timestamp>/provenance.json
  Latest:     research/results/<slug>/latest → <timestamp>
  Duration:   <N> seconds

Next step: /report <slug>
```

## Provenance Bundle

Every experiment run MUST produce a `provenance.json` file alongside results.
This is non-negotiable. The provenance bundle captures everything needed to
reproduce the exact run.

**Required fields:**

```json
{
  "git_sha": "string — output of git rev-parse HEAD",
  "git_dirty": "boolean — true if working tree has uncommitted changes",
  "branch": "string — current git branch name",
  "timestamp": "string — ISO 8601 UTC timestamp of run start",
  "wall_clock_seconds": "number — total execution time",
  "packages": "object — {package_name: version} for all research dependencies",
  "random_seeds": "array — all random seeds used in the experiment",
  "python_version": "string — or julia_version, matlab_version as appropriate",
  "platform": "string — e.g. darwin-arm64, linux-x86_64",
  "experiment_spec": "string — relative path to the spec.yaml file",
  "parameters": "object — the exact parameter grid used in this run",
  "baseline_ref": {
    "path": "string — relative path to baseline metrics file (if applicable)",
    "git_sha": "string — git SHA when baseline was last updated"
  }
}
```

**How to generate the provenance bundle:**

```python
import json, subprocess, sys, platform, time
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from pathlib import Path

def capture_provenance(spec_path, parameters, seeds, packages):
    prov = {
        "git_sha": subprocess.check_output(["git", "rev-parse", "HEAD"]).decode().strip(),
        "git_dirty": bool(subprocess.check_output(["git", "status", "--porcelain"]).decode().strip()),
        "branch": subprocess.check_output(["git", "branch", "--show-current"]).decode().strip(),
        "timestamp": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),
        "wall_clock_seconds": None,  # filled after run
        "packages": packages,
        "random_seeds": seeds,
        "python_version": sys.version.split()[0],
        "platform": f"{sys.platform}-{platform.machine()}",
        "experiment_spec": str(spec_path),
        "parameters": parameters,
    }
    return prov
```

The provenance generation code should be included in every generated experiment
script. After the experiment completes, fill in `wall_clock_seconds` and write
`provenance.json` to the results directory.
