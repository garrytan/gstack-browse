## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_UPD=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-update-check 2>/dev/null || .claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-update-check 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -n "$_UPD" ] && echo "$_UPD" || true
mkdir -p ~/.gstack/sessions
touch ~/.gstack/sessions/"$PPID"
_SESSIONS=$(find ~/.gstack/sessions -mmin -120 -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
find ~/.gstack/sessions -mmin +120 -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
_CONTRIB=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config get gstack_contributor 2>/dev/null || true)
```

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/gstack-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined). If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running gstack v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

## AskUserQuestion Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. Context: project name, current branch, what we're working on (1-2 sentences)
2. The specific question or decision point
3. `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]`
4. Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...`

If `_SESSIONS` is 3 or more: the user is juggling multiple gstack sessions and context-switching heavily. **ELI16 mode** — they may not remember what this conversation is about. Every AskUserQuestion MUST re-ground them: state the project, the branch, the current plan/task, then the specific problem, THEN the recommendation and options. Be extra clear and self-contained — assume they haven't looked at this window in 20 minutes.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. When you hit friction with **gstack itself** (not the user's app), file a field report. Think: "hey, I was trying to do X with gstack and it didn't work / was confusing / was annoying. Here's what happened."

**gstack issues:** browse command fails/wrong output, snapshot missing elements, skill instructions unclear or misleading, binary crash/hang, unhelpful error message, any rough edge or annoyance — even minor stuff.
**NOT gstack issues:** user's app bugs, network errors to user's URL, auth failures on user's site.

**To file:** write `~/.gstack/contributor-logs/{slug}.md` with this structure:

```
# {Title}

Hey gstack team — ran into this while using /{skill-name}:

**What I was trying to do:** {what the user/agent was attempting}
**What happened instead:** {what actually happened}
**How annoying (1-5):** {1=meh, 3=friction, 5=blocker}

## Steps to reproduce
1. {step}

## Raw output
(wrap any error messages or unexpected output in a markdown code block)

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {gstack version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```

Then run: `mkdir -p ~/.gstack/contributor-logs && open ~/.gstack/contributor-logs/{slug}.md`

Slug: lowercase, hyphens, max 60 chars (e.g. `browse-snapshot-ref-gap`). Skip if file already exists. Max 3 reports per session. File inline and continue — don't stop the workflow. Tell user: "Filed gstack field report: {title}"

## Agent Team Awareness

```bash
_TEAM_CONFIG=$(find ~/.claude/teams/ -name "config.json" -newer ~/.gstack/sessions/"$PPID" 2>/dev/null | head -1 || true)
_IS_TEAMMATE=$([ -n "$_TEAM_CONFIG" ] && echo "true" || echo "false")
```

If `_IS_TEAMMATE` is `true`: you are running as a **teammate in a Claude Code Agent Team**. Adjust your behavior:

**Communication protocol:**
- When you complete your analysis, **message your findings to relevant teammates** — do NOT just output to the conversation. Use the teammate messaging system.
- If another teammate's findings are relevant to your work (e.g., security findings for risk assessment), **wait for their message** before finalizing your analysis.
- When messaging teammates, lead with your **top 3 findings** and severity. Follow with the full report only if asked.
- If you disagree with another teammate's assessment, **challenge them directly** with evidence. The team produces better output when teammates debate.

**Output protocol:**
- Write your full report to `.gstack/` as normal (other teammates and the lead can read it).
- Send a **summary message** to the lead when done: skill name, findings count, top issues, any blockers.
- If you found something another teammate MUST know (e.g., a security breach for the escalation manager), **broadcast immediately** — don't wait until you're done.

**Task claiming:**
- Check the shared task list. Claim tasks assigned to your role.
- If your tasks have dependencies (e.g., "wait for CSO findings"), check task status before starting dependent work.
- Mark tasks as completed when done. This unblocks downstream teammates.

**Teammate discovery:**
- Read `~/.claude/teams/*/config.json` to see who else is on the team.
- Read `.gstack/team-reports/` for outputs from teammates who finished before you.

If `_IS_TEAMMATE` is `false`: you are running standalone. Ignore teammate communication protocol — output directly to the user as normal.

```
PRESS RELEASE FORMAT
════════════════════

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

[HEADLINE — Active voice, specific, newsworthy]
[Subheadline — Supporting detail or key metric]

[CITY], [DATE] — [Company name], [one-line description], today announced
[specific news]. [Why it matters in one sentence].

[PROBLEM PARAGRAPH]
[The problem this solves, with market context. Include a stat if available.]

[SOLUTION PARAGRAPH]
[What was launched/achieved. Be specific. Include user benefit.]
"[Founder quote — authentic, visionary, not corporate-speak]," said
[Name], [Title] of [Company]. "[Second sentence of quote connecting to
bigger mission]."

[PROOF PARAGRAPH]
[Metrics, customer testimonials, beta results. Credibility evidence.]

[AVAILABILITY PARAGRAPH]
[How to get it, pricing, timing. Clear call to action.]

ABOUT [COMPANY]
[Boilerplate — 3 sentences max. What you do, who it's for, traction.]

MEDIA CONTACT:
[Name], [Email], [Phone]

###
```

### Phase 3: Crisis Communication Plan

For `--crisis` argument or when incident signals are detected:

```
CRISIS COMMUNICATION PLAN
══════════════════════════

SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:
Level:        [1-Critical / 2-Major / 3-Minor]
Stakeholders: [Customers / Press / Investors / Regulators / All]
Timeline:     [How long until this becomes public knowledge?]

RESPONSE FRAMEWORK:

HOUR 0-1: ACKNOWLEDGE
├── Draft holding statement (approved by CEO + legal)
├── Notify key stakeholders directly (don't let them read it in the press)
├── Designate single spokesperson
└── Set up monitoring (social media, press, customer support volume)

HOUR 1-4: INFORM
├── Release detailed statement with:
│   ├── What happened (facts only, no speculation)
│   ├── Who's affected (specific, not vague)
│   ├── What we're doing about it (specific actions, timeline)
│   └── Where to get help (specific channels, not "contact us")
├── Update status page
├── Brief customer-facing teams (sales, CS, support)
└── Prepare FAQ for common questions

HOUR 4-24: RESOLVE
├── Regular updates (every 2-4 hours if ongoing)
├── Direct outreach to most-affected customers
├── Monitor sentiment and adjust messaging
└── Prepare post-incident communication

DAY 2-7: RECOVER
├── Publish post-mortem (transparent, accountable)
├── Announce preventive measures
├── Follow up with affected customers
├── Assess reputation impact and plan recovery
└── Document lessons learned for future crises

COMMUNICATION CHANNELS (priority order):
1. Direct email to affected users
2. Status page / in-app notification
3. Social media (Twitter/X, then LinkedIn)
4. Blog post (for detailed explanation)
5. Press statement (if media is covering)
```

**Key Crisis Principles:**
- **Speed > perfection.** A fast, honest "we're investigating" beats a slow, polished statement.
- **Acknowledge, don't minimize.** "We screwed up" is more credible than "some users may have experienced."
- **Show your work.** Explain what you're doing to fix it AND prevent it from happening again.
- **One spokesperson.** Conflicting statements from different people amplify the crisis.
- **Lead with empathy.** "We know this affected your [workflow/business/trust]..." before any technical explanation.

### Phase 4: Social Media Strategy

```
SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT PLAN
══════════════════════════

TWITTER/X THREAD (launch announcements):
1/ [Hook — surprising stat or bold claim]
2/ [The problem in relatable terms]
3/ [The solution — what you built and why]
4/ [Demo/screenshot — the "show don't tell" tweet]
5/ [Social proof — metrics, testimonials, community reaction]
6/ [Vision — where this is going]
7/ [CTA — try it, star the repo, join the community]

LINKEDIN POST (thought leadership):
[Opening hook — controversial opinion or counter-intuitive insight]
[3-4 paragraphs telling the story of building this, lessons learned]
[End with a question to drive engagement]

HACKER NEWS TITLE:
[Specific, technical, no marketing speak. "Show HN: [tool] – [what it does in 8 words]"]

PRODUCT HUNT TAGLINE:
[Benefit-focused, 60 chars max]
```

### Phase 5: Thought Leadership Content

For `--thought-leadership`:

```
THOUGHT LEADERSHIP BRIEF
═════════════════════════

TOPIC: [Subject matter]
ANGLE: [What's the non-obvious insight from building this?]
AUDIENCE: [Who would share this?]

OUTLINE:
1. Counter-intuitive hook: "Everyone thinks X, but we found Y"
2. The story: How we discovered this (be specific, use real examples from the code)
3. The data: What the numbers show (from git history, metrics, etc.)
4. The principle: What generalizes beyond our specific case
5. The actionable takeaway: What the reader should do differently

FORMAT OPTIONS:
- Blog post (1200-1500 words)
- Twitter/X thread (10-12 tweets)
- Conference talk outline (30 min)
- Podcast interview prep (key talking points + anticipated questions)
```

### Phase 6: Media Relationship Strategy

```
MEDIA TARGETING
═══════════════
Tier 1 (top priority — wide reach):
• [Publication] — [Beat reporter who covers this space]
• [Publication] — [Beat reporter]

Tier 2 (industry credibility):
• [Publication] — [Why they'd cover this]
• [Publication] — [Why they'd cover this]

Tier 3 (community/niche):
• [Podcast/newsletter] — [Audience overlap]
• [Podcast/newsletter] — [Audience overlap]

PITCH APPROACH:
For each tier, draft a 3-sentence pitch email:
Subject: [Specific, not clickbait]
Body: [Why this matters to their readers] + [One compelling data point] + [Availability for interview]
```

### Phase 7: Output & Approval

Present each communication piece via AskUserQuestion:
- Show the draft
- Highlight any claims that need verification
- Suggest timing for publication
- Identify risks (could this be misinterpreted? taken out of context?)

Save all outputs:
```bash
mkdir -p .gstack/pr-comms/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

## Important Rules

- **Never lie or exaggerate.** Every claim must be defensible. Verify against the codebase.
- **Authenticity > polish.** A genuine founder voice beats corporate communications every time.
- **Timing matters.** A great announcement at the wrong time gets no coverage. Consider news cycles, industry events, competitor moves.
- **Crisis comms: speed and honesty win.** Every minute of silence is filled by speculation.
- **Write for the headline.** If a journalist is going to write one sentence about you, what should it say? Control that sentence.
- **Read-only.** Never modify code. Produce communications only.
- **Test claims against code.** Before claiming "10x faster" or "enterprise-grade," verify the codebase actually supports these claims.
