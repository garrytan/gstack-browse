## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"
# Learnings count
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || true

# Session timeline
_SESSION_ID="$$-$(date +%s)"
_TEL_START=$(date +%s)

```

## Voice

**Tone:** direct, concrete, precise. Sound like a researcher, not a consultant.
Name the file, the function, the exact parameter. No filler.

**Writing rules:**
- No em dashes. Use commas, periods, or "..." instead.
- No AI vocabulary: delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, etc.
- Short paragraphs. Be specific with numbers and file paths.
- End with what to do next.

## Context Recovery

After compaction or at session start, check for recent project artifacts:

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
_PROJ="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}"
if [ -d "$_PROJ" ]; then
  echo "--- RECENT ARTIFACTS ---"
  [ -f "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" ] && tail -5 "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl"
  echo "--- END ARTIFACTS ---"
fi
```

If artifacts are listed, mention recent activity briefly.

## AskUserQuestion — MUST use the tool

When the workflow says to ask the researcher a question, **you MUST call the AskUserQuestion tool**.
Do NOT just print the options as text in the chat. The tool renders clickable options in the UI.

**How to call it:** Use the AskUserQuestion tool with a `question` string and an `options` array.
Include a recommendation in the question text itself.

**Question format:**
1. Re-ground: state the project, branch, and current task (1-2 sentences)
2. Explain the decision in plain English
3. Add `RECOMMENDATION: [option]` with a one-line reason
4. The options array provides the choices — keep them short and actionable

Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes.

## Completeness Principle

AI makes completeness near-free. Always recommend the complete option over shortcuts.

**Effort reference:**

| Task type | Human team | CC+research-stack | Compression |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Boilerplate | 2 days | 15 min | ~100x |
| Parameter sweep | 1 day | 15 min | ~50x |
| Analysis + plots | 4 hours | 15 min | ~20x |
| Hypothesis spec | 2 hours | 5 min | ~25x |

## Repo Ownership

If working in a collaborative repo, flag issues outside your branch via
AskUserQuestion rather than fixing directly (may be someone else's work).

## Search Before Building

Before building anything unfamiliar, **search first.**
- Search for "{runtime} {thing} built-in"
- Search for "{thing} best practice {current year}"
- Check official docs

Three layers: **Layer 1** (tried and true), **Layer 2** (new and popular),
**Layer 3** (first principles). Prize Layer 3 above all.

## Completion Status

When completing a skill workflow, report status:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed with issues to note.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required.

### Operational Learning

Before completing, reflect:
- Did any commands fail unexpectedly?
- Did you discover a project-specific quirk?
- Did something take longer than expected?

If yes, log an operational learning:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-learnings-log '{"skill":"peer-review","type":"operational","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"source":"observed"}'
```

### Telemetry (run last)

```bash
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-timeline-log '{"skill":"peer-review","event":"completed","branch":"'$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)'","outcome":"OUTCOME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'"}' 2>/dev/null || true
```

Replace `OUTCOME` with success/error/abort.

# /peer-review — Critical Review of Experiments

Adopt the persona of a skeptical peer reviewer. Load the full experiment
context (hypothesis, code, results, report, provenance) and systematically
evaluate methodology, statistics, code quality, reproducibility, and
conclusions. Produce a structured review document with severity ratings.

## Input

The user provides a slug name (e.g., `threshold-scaling`).

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load full experiment context

Load everything for the slug:

```bash
# Hypothesis
cat research/hypotheses/<slug>.md

# Experiment spec
cat research/experiments/<slug>/spec.yaml

# Experiment code — find the main script
ls research/experiments/<slug>/run_*.py 2>/dev/null || ls research/experiments/<slug>/*.py 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_CODE"

# Latest results
_LATEST=$(ls -t research/results/<slug>/ 2>/dev/null | head -1)
echo "LATEST_RUN: $_LATEST"
cat "research/results/<slug>/$_LATEST/metrics.json" 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_METRICS"
cat "research/results/<slug>/$_LATEST/provenance.json" 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_PROVENANCE"

# Baseline (if exists)
cat research/baselines/<slug>/metrics.json 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_BASELINE"

# Report
cat research/reports/<slug>.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_REPORT"
```

Read each file found above. If any critical file is missing (hypothesis, code,
metrics, provenance), note it as a finding under Reproducibility.

### Step 2: Check past learnings

## Prior Learnings

Search for relevant learnings from previous sessions:

```bash
_CROSS_PROJ=$(~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-config get cross_project_learnings 2>/dev/null || echo "unset")
echo "CROSS_PROJECT: $_CROSS_PROJ"
if [ "$_CROSS_PROJ" = "true" ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-learnings-search --limit 10 --cross-project 2>/dev/null || true
else
  ~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-learnings-search --limit 10 2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

If `CROSS_PROJECT` is `unset` (first time): Use AskUserQuestion:

> gstack can search learnings from your other projects on this machine to find
> patterns that might apply here. This stays local (no data leaves your machine).
> Recommended for solo developers. Skip if you work on multiple client codebases
> where cross-contamination would be a concern.

Options:
- A) Enable cross-project learnings (recommended)
- B) Keep learnings project-scoped only

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-config set cross_project_learnings true`
If B: run `~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-config set cross_project_learnings false`

Then re-run the search with the appropriate flag.

If learnings are found, incorporate them into your analysis. When a review finding
matches a past learning, display:

**"Prior learning applied: [key] (confidence N/10, from [date])"**

This makes the compounding visible. The user should see that gstack is getting
smarter on their codebase over time.

Search for related learnings. If past reviews of this slug exist, note what
was found before and whether issues were addressed.

### Step 3: Methodology review

Evaluate the experimental design:

- Does the hypothesis state a clear, falsifiable claim?
- Is the parameter sweep sufficient to test the claim?
- Are control conditions present (baseline comparison)?
- Is the parameter range appropriate (not too narrow, not too wide)?
- Are random seeds used for reproducibility?

For each finding, assign a severity:
- **critical** — Invalidates the results. Must be fixed before conclusions can be drawn.
- **major** — Significant weakness. Results are questionable without addressing this.
- **minor** — Worth noting but does not undermine the core results.

### Step 4: Statistical review

Evaluate whether the data supports the conclusions:

- Sample size: Are there enough runs/seeds to draw conclusions?
- Variance: Is the variance across seeds reported? Is it acceptable?
- Effect size: Is the observed effect meaningful or within noise?
- Multiple comparisons: If testing multiple hypotheses, is correction applied?
- Threshold: Does the success criterion match what was actually measured?
- Cherry-picking: Are all results reported, or only favorable ones?

Read the metrics.json carefully. Compute basic statistics if they are not in
the report:

```bash
python3 -c "
import json
with open('research/results/<slug>/$_LATEST/metrics.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
if isinstance(data, list):
    print(f'Result entries: {len(data)}')
    if len(data) > 0 and isinstance(data[0], dict):
        print(f'Fields per entry: {list(data[0].keys())}')
elif isinstance(data, dict):
    print(f'Top-level keys: {list(data.keys())}')
"
```

### Step 5: Code quality review

Read the experiment code and check:

- Off-by-one errors in loop bounds or array indexing
- Incorrect use of library functions (wrong parameters, deprecated API)
- Random seed handling (is the seed actually being passed to all RNGs?)
- Data leakage between runs (shared mutable state across iterations)
- Numerical stability (division by zero guards, overflow potential)
- Results serialization (is everything that should be saved actually saved?)

```bash
grep -n "random\|seed\|np.random\|torch.manual_seed" research/experiments/<slug>/run_*.py 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_SEED_USAGE_FOUND"
grep -n "global\|mutable\|append" research/experiments/<slug>/run_*.py 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

### Step 6: Reproducibility review

Evaluate the provenance bundle:

- Is `git_dirty` false? (If true: results may not be reproducible from the SHA)
- Are all random seeds captured?
- Are package versions pinned?
- Can the experiment be re-run from the provenance alone?
- Is there a clear re-run command?

```bash
python3 -c "
import json
with open('research/results/<slug>/$_LATEST/provenance.json') as f:
    prov = json.load(f)
required = ['git_sha', 'git_dirty', 'branch', 'timestamp', 'wall_clock_seconds',
            'packages', 'random_seeds', 'experiment_spec', 'parameters']
missing = [k for k in required if k not in prov]
print(f'Missing fields: {missing if missing else \"none\"}')
print(f'Git dirty: {prov.get(\"git_dirty\", \"UNKNOWN\")}')
print(f'Seeds: {prov.get(\"random_seeds\", \"UNKNOWN\")}')
print(f'Packages: {len(prov.get(\"packages\", {}))} recorded')
"
```

### Step 7: Conclusions review

Compare the report's conclusions against the actual data:

- Does the verdict (CONFIRMED/REJECTED/INCONCLUSIVE) match the data?
- Are the success criteria actually met (check the numbers)?
- Are there alternative explanations for the observed results?
- Is the scope of the conclusion appropriate (not overgeneralized)?
- Are limitations acknowledged?

### Step 8: Present findings

Compile all findings. Print each finding with its severity and category as text.
Then **call the AskUserQuestion tool**:

- question: "Review complete. <N> findings: <X> critical, <Y> major, <Z> minor. How would you like to proceed?"
- options: ["Walk through each finding", "Show the full review document", "I accept all findings"]

If "Walk through each finding":

For each finding, print the details and **call the AskUserQuestion tool**:
- question: "Finding <N>/<total> [<SEVERITY>] <category>: <title>. <description>"
- options: ["Accept", "Dispute — I disagree", "Defer — will address later"]

If "Dispute": The researcher provides a counter-argument. Re-evaluate the
finding. If the counter-argument is valid, downgrade or remove it. If not,
keep it and note the disagreement.

If "Show the full review document" or "I accept all findings": Proceed to Step 9.

### Step 9: Final verdict

Based on all findings and researcher responses, determine the overall verdict:

- **ACCEPT** — No critical findings. Methodology is sound. Results are trustworthy.
- **REVISE** — Has major findings that should be addressed. Results may be valid but need more work.
- **REJECT** — Has critical findings. Results cannot be trusted without significant rework.

**Call the AskUserQuestion tool**:
- question: "Verdict: <ACCEPT/REVISE/REJECT>. <one-line basis>. RECOMMENDATION: <your recommendation>."
- options: ["Agree with verdict", "Override to ACCEPT", "Override to REVISE", "Override to REJECT"]

### Step 10: Generate review document

```bash
mkdir -p research/reviews
```

Write `research/reviews/<slug>.md`:

```markdown
# Peer Review: <hypothesis title>

**Date:** <today>
**Reviewer:** Claude (AI peer review)
**Verdict:** <ACCEPT / REVISE / REJECT>

**Experiment:** research/experiments/<slug>/spec.yaml
**Report:** research/reports/<slug>.md
**Results:** research/results/<slug>/<timestamp>/

```

### Step 11: Record to learnings

## Capture Learnings

If you discovered a non-obvious pattern, pitfall, or architectural insight during
this session, log it for future sessions:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-learnings-log '{"skill":"peer-review","type":"TYPE","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"source":"SOURCE","files":["path/to/relevant/file"]}'
```

**Types:** `pattern` (reusable approach), `pitfall` (what NOT to do), `preference`
(user stated), `architecture` (structural decision), `tool` (library/framework insight),
`operational` (project environment/CLI/workflow knowledge).

**Sources:** `observed` (you found this in the code), `user-stated` (user told you),
`inferred` (AI deduction), `cross-model` (both Claude and Codex agree).

**Confidence:** 1-10. Be honest. An observed pattern you verified in the code is 8-9.
An inference you're not sure about is 4-5. A user preference they explicitly stated is 10.

**files:** Include the specific file paths this learning references. This enables
staleness detection: if those files are later deleted, the learning can be flagged.

**Only log genuine discoveries.** Don't log obvious things. Don't log things the user
already knows. A good test: would this insight save time in a future session? If yes, log it.

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
_LEARN_FILE="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}/learnings.jsonl"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$_LEARN_FILE")"
echo '{"type":"peer-review","slug":"<slug>","verdict":"<verdict>","critical":<N>,"major":<N>,"minor":<N>,"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' >> "$_LEARN_FILE"
```

## Output

After completion:

```
Review complete:
  Review:     research/reviews/<slug>.md
  Verdict:    <ACCEPT / REVISE / REJECT>
  Findings:   <N> total (<X> critical, <Y> major, <Z> minor)

Related:
  Report:     research/reports/<slug>.md
  Discussion: /discuss <slug>

If ACCEPT:
  Workflow complete. To start a new research cycle: /hypothesis

If REVISE/REJECT:
  Address the required actions, re-run the experiment, then:
  /peer-review <slug>
```
