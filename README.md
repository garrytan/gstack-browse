# gemini-gstack

A Gemini CLI fork of [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) — the AI engineering workflow framework by [Garry Tan](https://x.com/garrytan).

**What this is:** All of gstack's workflow skills (CEO review, eng review, QA, ship, etc.) and the headless browser, adapted to run natively on [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli). No Claude Code dependency. No Anthropic API key required.

**What this is not:** A drop-in replacement for gstack. Claude-specific features (sidebar agent model routing, design binary GPT Image API, Codex cross-model review) are removed or stubbed. The core workflow — think, plan, build, review, test, ship — works identically.

## Why this fork exists

gstack is excellent. But if your team has a Gemini subscription and not a Claude subscription, the original gstack doesn't help you. This fork makes every skill available through Gemini CLI as a native extension.

**What works:**
- All 23+ workflow skills (office-hours, review, qa, ship, etc.)
- Headless browser (`/browse`) — real Chromium, real clicks, ~100ms per command
- Safety guardrails (careful, freeze, guard)
- Multi-host generation for Codex, Factory, Kiro, and other agents
- Full test suite

**What's removed:**
- Claude Code as a host (no `hosts/claude.ts`, no Claude install path)
- OpenClaw integration
- Design binary (GPT Image API — would need Gemini Imagen equivalent)
- Sidebar agent model routing (was Sonnet/Opus specific)
- Codex cross-model second opinion skill

## Quick start

**Requirements:** [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.0+

### Install (30 seconds)

```bash
git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/bjohnson135/gemini-gstack.git ~/.gemini/extensions/gstack
cd ~/.gemini/extensions/gstack && ./setup
```

Then add a gstack section to your project's `GEMINI.md`:

```markdown
## gstack
Use /browse from gstack for all web browsing.
Available skills: /office-hours, /plan-ceo-review, /plan-eng-review, /plan-design-review,
/design-consultation, /design-shotgun, /design-html, /review, /ship, /land-and-deploy,
/canary, /benchmark, /browse, /qa, /qa-only, /design-review, /setup-browser-cookies,
/setup-deploy, /retro, /investigate, /document-release, /cso, /autoplan, /plan-devex-review,
/devex-review, /careful, /freeze, /guard, /unfreeze, /gstack-upgrade, /learn.
```

### Other AI agents

gstack also generates skills for other AI coding agents:

```bash
./setup --host <name>
```

| Agent | Flag | Skills install to |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| OpenAI Codex CLI | `--host codex` | `~/.codex/skills/gstack-*/` |
| OpenCode | `--host opencode` | `~/.config/opencode/skills/gstack-*/` |
| Cursor | `--host cursor` | `~/.cursor/skills/gstack-*/` |
| Factory Droid | `--host factory` | `~/.factory/skills/gstack-*/` |
| Slate | `--host slate` | `~/.slate/skills/gstack-*/` |
| Kiro | `--host kiro` | `~/.kiro/skills/gstack-*/` |

## See it work

```
You:    I want to build a daily briefing app for my calendar.
You:    /office-hours
Gemini: [asks about the pain — specific examples, not hypotheticals]

You:    Multiple Google calendars, events with stale info, wrong locations.
        Prep takes forever and the results aren't good enough...

Gemini: I'm going to push back on the framing. You said "daily briefing
        app." But what you actually described is a personal chief of
        staff AI.
        [extracts 5 capabilities you didn't realize you were describing]
        [challenges 4 premises — you agree, disagree, or adjust]
        [generates 3 implementation approaches with effort estimates]

You:    /plan-ceo-review
        [reads the design doc, challenges scope, runs 10-section review]

You:    /plan-eng-review
        [ASCII diagrams for data flow, state machines, error paths]

You:    Approve plan. Build it.
        [writes 2,400 lines across 11 files]

You:    /review
        [AUTO-FIXED] 2 issues. [ASK] Race condition → you approve fix.

You:    /qa https://staging.myapp.com
        [opens real browser, clicks through flows, finds and fixes a bug]

You:    /ship
        Tests: 42 → 51 (+9 new). PR: github.com/you/app/pull/42
```

Eight commands, end to end. That is not a copilot. That is a team.

## The sprint

gstack is a process, not a collection of tools. The skills run in the order a sprint runs:

**Think → Plan → Build → Review → Test → Ship → Reflect**

Each skill feeds into the next. `/office-hours` writes a design doc that `/plan-ceo-review` reads. `/plan-eng-review` writes a test plan that `/qa` picks up. `/review` catches bugs that `/ship` verifies are fixed.

| Skill | Your specialist | What they do |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| `/office-hours` | **YC Office Hours** | Start here. Six forcing questions that reframe your product before you write code. |
| `/plan-ceo-review` | **CEO / Founder** | Rethink the problem. Find the 10-star product hiding inside the request. |
| `/plan-eng-review` | **Eng Manager** | Lock in architecture, data flow, diagrams, edge cases, and tests. |
| `/plan-design-review` | **Senior Designer** | Rates each design dimension 0-10, explains what a 10 looks like. AI Slop detection. |
| `/plan-devex-review` | **DX Lead** | Interactive DX review: developer personas, TTHW benchmarks, friction point tracing. |
| `/design-consultation` | **Design Partner** | Build a complete design system from scratch. |
| `/review` | **Staff Engineer** | Find the bugs that pass CI but blow up in production. Auto-fixes the obvious ones. |
| `/investigate` | **Debugger** | Systematic root-cause debugging. No fixes without investigation. |
| `/design-review` | **Designer Who Codes** | Same audit as /plan-design-review, then fixes what it finds. |
| `/devex-review` | **DX Tester** | Live developer experience audit — actually tests your onboarding. |
| `/design-shotgun` | **Design Explorer** | Generates 4-6 AI mockup variants, opens comparison board, iterates on feedback. |
| `/design-html` | **Design Engineer** | Turn a mockup into production HTML. Pretext computed layout, 30KB, zero deps. |
| `/qa` | **QA Lead** | Test your app, find bugs, fix them, re-verify with regression tests. |
| `/qa-only` | **QA Reporter** | Same methodology as /qa but report only. No code changes. |
| `/pair-agent` | **Multi-Agent Coordinator** | Share your browser with any AI agent. Scoped tokens, tab isolation. |
| `/cso` | **Chief Security Officer** | OWASP Top 10 + STRIDE threat model. Zero-noise, 8/10+ confidence gate. |
| `/ship` | **Release Engineer** | Sync main, run tests, audit coverage, push, open PR. |
| `/land-and-deploy` | **Release Engineer** | Merge PR, wait for CI and deploy, verify production health. |
| `/canary` | **SRE** | Post-deploy monitoring loop for errors and regressions. |
| `/benchmark` | **Performance Engineer** | Baseline page load times, Core Web Vitals, resource sizes. |
| `/document-release` | **Technical Writer** | Update all project docs to match what you just shipped. |
| `/retro` | **Eng Manager** | Team-aware weekly retro with per-person breakdowns and shipping streaks. |
| `/browse` | **QA Engineer** | Real Chromium browser, real clicks, real screenshots. ~100ms per command. |
| `/autoplan` | **Review Pipeline** | One command: CEO → design → eng review automatically. |
| `/learn` | **Memory** | Manage what gstack learned across sessions. Learnings compound over time. |

### Power tools

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/careful` | **Safety Guardrails** — warns before destructive commands (rm -rf, DROP TABLE, force-push). |
| `/freeze` | **Edit Lock** — restrict file edits to one directory. |
| `/guard` | **Full Safety** — `/careful` + `/freeze` in one command. |
| `/unfreeze` | **Unlock** — remove the `/freeze` boundary. |
| `/setup-deploy` | **Deploy Configurator** — one-time setup for `/land-and-deploy`. |
| `/gstack-upgrade` | **Self-Updater** — upgrade gstack to latest. |

### Voice input (AquaVoice, Whisper, etc.)

gstack skills have voice-friendly trigger phrases. Say what you want naturally —
"run a security check", "test the website", "do an engineering review" — and the
right skill activates.

## Uninstall

### Option 1: Run the uninstall script

```bash
~/.gemini/extensions/gstack/bin/gstack-uninstall
```

This handles skills, symlinks, global state (`~/.gstack/`), browse daemons, and temp files. Use `--keep-state` to preserve config and analytics. Use `--force` to skip confirmation.

### Option 2: Manual removal

```bash
# 1. Stop browse daemons
pkill -f "gstack.*browse" 2>/dev/null || true

# 2. Remove gstack extension
rm -rf ~/.gemini/extensions/gstack

# 3. Remove global state
rm -rf ~/.gstack

# 4. Remove other host integrations (skip any you never installed)
rm -rf ~/.codex/skills/gstack* 2>/dev/null
rm -rf ~/.factory/skills/gstack* 2>/dev/null
rm -rf ~/.kiro/skills/gstack* 2>/dev/null

# 5. Remove temp files
rm -f /tmp/gstack-* 2>/dev/null

# 6. Per-project cleanup (run from each project root)
rm -rf .gstack .gstack-worktrees .gemini/extensions/gstack 2>/dev/null
rm -rf .agents/skills/gstack* .factory/skills/gstack* 2>/dev/null
```

### Clean up GEMINI.md

The uninstall script does not edit GEMINI.md. In each project where gstack was added, remove the `## gstack` and `## Skill routing` sections.

### Playwright

`~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/` (macOS) is left in place because other tools may share it. Remove it if nothing else needs it.

## Privacy & Telemetry

gstack includes **opt-in** usage telemetry to help improve the project. Here's exactly what happens:

- **Default is off.** Nothing is sent anywhere unless you explicitly say yes.
- **On first run,** gstack asks if you want to share anonymous usage data. You can say no.
- **What's sent (if you opt in):** skill name, duration, success/fail, gstack version, OS. That's it.
- **What's never sent:** code, file paths, repo names, branch names, prompts, or any user-generated content.
- **Change anytime:** `gstack-config set telemetry off` disables everything instantly.

**Local analytics are always available.** Run `gstack-analytics` to see your personal usage dashboard from the local JSONL file — no remote data needed.

## Troubleshooting

**Skill not showing up?** `cd ~/.gemini/extensions/gstack && ./setup`

**`/browse` fails?** `cd ~/.gemini/extensions/gstack && bun install && bun run build`

**Stale install?** Run `/gstack-upgrade` — or set `auto_upgrade: true` in `~/.gstack/config.yaml`

**Want shorter commands?** `cd ~/.gemini/extensions/gstack && ./setup --no-prefix`

**Want namespaced commands?** `cd ~/.gemini/extensions/gstack && ./setup --prefix`

**Windows users:** gstack works on Windows 11 via Git Bash or WSL. Node.js is required in addition to Bun — Bun has a known bug with Playwright's pipe transport on Windows ([bun#4253](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/4253)). The browse server automatically falls back to Node.js. Make sure both `bun` and `node` are on your PATH.

**Gemini can't see the skills?** Make sure your project's `GEMINI.md` has a gstack section listing the available skills (see Quick Start above).
