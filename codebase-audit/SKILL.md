  Full codebase audit. Analyzes an entire project cold — no diff, no branch context —
  producing a structured report covering bugs, security issues, architectural problems,
  tech debt, test gaps, and improvement opportunities. Read-only — never modifies code.
  Use when asked to "audit this codebase", "codebase health", "tech debt assessment",
  "code quality review", "what's wrong with this code", or "analyze this codebase".
  NOT for reviewing a diff or PR — use /review for that.

## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_UPD=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-update-check 2>/dev/null || .claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-update-check 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -n "$_UPD" ] && echo "$_UPD" || true

echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"
echo "PROACTIVE: $_PROACTIVE"

echo "LAKE_INTRO: $_LAKE_SEEN"

```

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not proactively suggest gstack skills — only invoke
them when the user explicitly asks. The user opted out of proactive suggestions.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/gstack-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined). If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running gstack v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Before continuing, introduce the Completeness Principle.
Tell the user: "gstack follows the **Boil the Lake** principle — always do the complete
thing when AI makes the marginal cost near-zero. Read more: https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean"
Then offer to open the essay in their default browser:

```bash
open https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean
touch ~/.gstack/.completeness-intro-seen
```

Only run `open` if the user says yes. Always run `touch` to mark as seen. This only happens once.

If `TEL_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `LAKE_INTRO` is `yes`: After the lake intro is handled,
ask the user about telemetry. Use AskUserQuestion:

> Help gstack get better! Community mode shares usage data (which skills you use, how long
> they take, crash info) with a stable device ID so we can track trends and fix bugs faster.
> No code, file paths, or repo names are ever sent.
> Change anytime with `gstack-config set telemetry off`.

Options:
- A) Help gstack get better! (recommended)
- B) No thanks

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry community`

If B: ask a follow-up AskUserQuestion:

> How about anonymous mode? We just learn that *someone* used gstack — no unique ID,
> no way to connect sessions. Just a counter that helps us know if anyone's out there.

Options:
- A) Sure, anonymous is fine
- B) No thanks, fully off

If B→A: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry anonymous`
If B→B: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry off`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.gstack/.telemetry-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `TEL_PROMPTED` is `yes`, skip this entirely.

## AskUserQuestion Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. **Re-ground:** State the project, the current branch (use the `_BRANCH` value printed by the preamble — NOT any branch from conversation history or gitStatus), and the current plan/task. (1-2 sentences)
2. **Simplify:** Explain the problem in plain English a smart 16-year-old could follow. No raw function names, no internal jargon, no implementation details. Use concrete examples and analogies. Say what it DOES, not what it's called.
3. **Recommend:** `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]` — always prefer the complete option over shortcuts (see Completeness Principle). Include `Completeness: X/10` for each option. Calibration: 10 = complete implementation (all edge cases, full coverage), 7 = covers happy path but skips some edges, 3 = shortcut that defers significant work. If both options are 8+, pick the higher; if one is ≤5, flag it.
4. **Options:** Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...` — when an option involves effort, show both scales: `(human: ~X / CC: ~Y)`

Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes and doesn't have the code open. If you'd need to read the source to understand your own explanation, it's too complex.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Completeness Principle — Boil the Lake

AI-assisted coding makes the marginal cost of completeness near-zero. When you present options:

- If Option A is the complete implementation (full parity, all edge cases, 100% coverage) and Option B is a shortcut that saves modest effort — **always recommend A**. The delta between 80 lines and 150 lines is meaningless with CC+gstack. "Good enough" is the wrong instinct when "complete" costs minutes more.
- **Lake vs. ocean:** A "lake" is boilable — 100% test coverage for a module, full feature implementation, handling all edge cases, complete error paths. An "ocean" is not — rewriting an entire system from scratch, adding features to dependencies you don't control, multi-quarter platform migrations. Recommend boiling lakes. Flag oceans as out of scope.
- **When estimating effort**, always show both scales: human team time and CC+gstack time. The compression ratio varies by task type — use this reference:

| Task type | Human team | CC+gstack | Compression |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Boilerplate / scaffolding | 2 days | 15 min | ~100x |
| Test writing | 1 day | 15 min | ~50x |
| Feature implementation | 1 week | 30 min | ~30x |
| Bug fix + regression test | 4 hours | 15 min | ~20x |
| Architecture / design | 2 days | 4 hours | ~5x |
| Research / exploration | 1 day | 3 hours | ~3x |

- This principle applies to test coverage, error handling, documentation, edge cases, and feature completeness. Don't skip the last 10% to "save time" — with AI, that 10% costs seconds.

**Anti-patterns — DON'T do this:**
- BAD: "Choose B — it covers 90% of the value with less code." (If A is only 70 lines more, choose A.)
- BAD: "We can skip edge case handling to save time." (Edge case handling costs minutes with CC.)
- BAD: "Let's defer test coverage to a follow-up PR." (Tests are the cheapest lake to boil.)
- BAD: Quoting only human-team effort: "This would take 2 weeks." (Say: "2 weeks human / ~1 hour CC.")

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. You're a gstack user who also helps make it better.

**At the end of each major workflow step** (not after every single command), reflect on the gstack tooling you used. Rate your experience 0 to 10. If it wasn't a 10, think about why. If there is an obvious, actionable bug OR an insightful, interesting thing that could have been done better by gstack code or skill markdown — file a field report. Maybe our contributor will help make us better!

**Calibration — this is the bar:** For example, `$B js "await fetch(...)"` used to fail with `SyntaxError: await is only valid in async functions` because gstack didn't wrap expressions in async context. Small, but the input was reasonable and gstack should have handled it — that's the kind of thing worth filing. Things less consequential than this, ignore.

**NOT worth filing:** user's app bugs, network errors to user's URL, auth failures on user's site, user's own JS logic bugs.

**To file:** write `~/.gstack/contributor-logs/{slug}.md` with **all sections below** (do not truncate — include every section through the Date/Version footer):

```
# {Title}

Hey gstack team — ran into this while using /{skill-name}:

**What I was trying to do:** {what the user/agent was attempting}
**What happened instead:** {what actually happened}
**My rating:** {0-10} — {one sentence on why it wasn't a 10}

## Steps to reproduce
1. {step}

## Raw output
```
{paste the actual error or unexpected output here}
```

## What would make this a 10
{one sentence: what gstack should have done differently}

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {gstack version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```

Slug: lowercase, hyphens, max 60 chars (e.g. `browse-js-no-await`). Skip if file already exists. Max 3 reports per session. File inline and continue — don't stop the workflow. Tell user: "Filed gstack field report: {title}"

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Telemetry (run last)

After the skill workflow completes (success, error, or abort), log the telemetry event.
Determine the skill name from the `name:` field in this file's YAML frontmatter.
Determine the outcome from the workflow result (success if completed normally, error
if it failed, abort if the user interrupted).

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This command writes telemetry to
`~/.gstack/analytics/` (user config directory, not project files). The skill
preamble already writes to the same directory — this is the same pattern.
Skipping this command loses session duration and outcome data.

Run this bash:

```bash
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
rm -f ~/.gstack/analytics/.pending-"$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null || true
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-telemetry-log \
  --skill "SKILL_NAME" --duration "$_TEL_DUR" --outcome "OUTCOME" \
  --used-browse "USED_BROWSE" --session-id "$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null &
```

Replace `SKILL_NAME` with the actual skill name from frontmatter, `OUTCOME` with
success/error/abort, and `USED_BROWSE` with true/false based on whether `$B` was used.
If you cannot determine the outcome, use "unknown". This runs in the background and
never blocks the user.

# /codebase-audit — Cold-Start Codebase Audit

Performs a full read-only audit of a codebase from scratch. No diff, no branch context — just the code as it exists right now. Produces a structured report with health score, findings by severity, and actionable recommendations.

You MUST NOT modify any source code. Your only Write operations are the report and baseline files in `~/.gstack/`.

## Modes

Detect the mode from arguments:

- **Full** (default, no flags): Run all 4 phases. Produces a complete report. Typically 10-30 minutes depending on codebase size.
- **Quick** (`--quick`): Phase 1 only, plus the top 10 checklist patterns tagged `[QUICK]`. Produces a slim report: project profile, health score, top 5 findings. Target: under 2 minutes.
- **Regression** (automatic): If a previous `baseline.json` exists in `~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/audits/`, run the full audit and diff against the previous baseline. No flag needed — detected automatically.

## Arguments

- `/codebase-audit` — full audit of the current project
- `/codebase-audit --quick` — quick smoke audit (2-min health check)

---

## Phase 1: Orientation

Goal: understand what this project is, how big it is, what it's built with, and its recent health signals.

### 1.1 Project identity

Resolve the project slug for output paths:

```bash
eval $(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)
echo "SLUG=$SLUG"
```

If `gstack-slug` fails (not a git repo, no remote), use the current directory name as the slug.

### 1.2 Language and framework detection

Scan for build files, configs, and entry points to detect the tech stack:

```bash
ls -la package.json Cargo.toml go.mod pyproject.toml Gemfile build.gradle pom.xml Makefile CMakeLists.txt *.csproj *.sln composer.json mix.exs 2>/dev/null
```

Read whichever build/config files exist to determine: primary language, framework, build tool, test runner, package manager.

### 1.3 Codebase stats

Count lines of code, excluding vendored and build directories:

```bash
find . -type f -not -path '*/node_modules/*' -not -path '*/vendor/*' -not -path '*/.git/*' -not -path '*/dist/*' -not -path '*/build/*' -not -path '*/.next/*' -not -path '*/target/*' -not -path '*/__pycache__/*' -not -path '*/venv/*' | head -5000 | xargs wc -l 2>/dev/null | tail -1
```

If `cloc` is available, prefer it for a more accurate breakdown by language.

Classify the codebase size:
- **Small**: <10K LOC
- **Medium**: 10K–50K LOC
- **Large**: >50K LOC

### 1.4 Read orientation docs

Read these files if they exist: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Skip any that don't exist — do not error.

### 1.5 Git state

If this is a git repo, gather recent activity:

```bash
git log --oneline -10
git log --format='%aN' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10
```

If this is not a git repo, note that and skip all git-dependent steps gracefully.

### 1.6 Git churn analysis

Identify hotspot files (most frequently changed in the last 90 days):

```bash
git log --since=90.days --name-only --format="" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
```

Estimate bus factor for the top 5 hotspot files — how many unique authors have touched each:

```bash
git log --format='%aN' -- <file> | sort -u | wc -l
```

Skip this step if the repo is not a git repo or is a shallow clone.

### 1.7 Dependency vulnerability check

Detect the package manager and run the appropriate audit command if available:

- **npm/yarn**: `npm audit --json 2>/dev/null`
- **Ruby**: `bundle audit --format json 2>/dev/null`
- **Python**: `pip-audit --format json 2>/dev/null`
- **Rust**: `cargo audit --json 2>/dev/null`
- **Go**: `govulncheck ./... 2>/dev/null`

If the audit tool is not installed or the command fails, skip gracefully and note "dependency audit tool not available" in the report.

### 1.8 Size-based strategy decision

Based on codebase size from step 1.3:
- **Small** (<10K LOC): Read everything. Full coverage is feasible.
- **Medium** (10K–50K LOC): Read high-risk files fully (entry points, auth, payment, data access, configs). Sample the rest using Grep pattern matches.
- **Large** (>50K LOC): Use AskUserQuestion to ask the user which areas to focus on. Suggest the top 3 areas based on churn hotspots and framework-specific risk areas. Do not proceed until the user responds.

If in quick mode, stop after this phase. Jump to the Phase 3 quick-mode subset (top 10 `[QUICK]` patterns only), then skip to Phase 4 for the slim report.

---

## Phase 2: Architecture Scan

Skip this phase entirely in quick mode.

### 2.1 Map entry points and boundaries

Read the main entry points: app bootstrap files, routers, API handlers, CLI entry points. Identify:
- What the application does (web server, CLI, library, service, monorepo)
- Major components and their boundaries
- External dependencies and integrations (databases, APIs, queues, caches)
- Data flow: how requests/data enter, transform, and exit

### 2.2 Identify layers

Map the architectural layers: presentation, business logic, data access, infrastructure. Note which layers exist and which are missing or blurred.

### 2.3 Configuration and environment

Read configuration files, environment variable usage, and secrets management. Look for:
- Hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Environment-specific configuration
- Feature flags
- Build/deploy configuration

### 2.4 Output architecture diagram

Produce an ASCII architecture diagram showing components, their relationships, data flow, and external dependencies. Keep it to 20-30 lines maximum. This goes in the report.

---

## Phase 3: Targeted Deep Dives

In quick mode, run only the top 10 patterns tagged `[QUICK]` from the checklist, then skip to Phase 4.

In full mode, run the complete checklist.

### 3.1 Load checklists

Use the **Read tool** (not Bash cat) to load the primary checklist:

`~/.claude/skills/gstack/codebase-audit/checklist.md`

If the checklist file is unreadable or missing, STOP and report an error: "Audit checklist not found at ~/.claude/skills/gstack/codebase-audit/checklist.md — cannot continue." Do not proceed without it.

Then use the **Read tool** to load the supplemental patterns reference:

`~/.claude/skills/gstack/codebase-audit/references/patterns.md`

### 3.2 Load custom checklist

If the target project contains `.gstack/audit-checklist.md`, read it and append its items to the checklist. This allows projects to define custom audit rules.

### 3.3 Execute checklist

Work through the checklist in priority order:

1. **Security** — injection, auth bypass, secrets exposure, SSRF, path traversal
2. **Correctness** — logic errors, race conditions, null safety, error handling
3. **Reliability** — crash paths, resource leaks, timeout handling, retry logic
4. **Tests** — coverage gaps, test quality, missing edge cases, flaky patterns
5. **Architecture** — coupling, abstraction leaks, circular dependencies, god classes
6. **Tech Debt** — dead code, TODO/FIXME/HACK comments, deprecated APIs, copy-paste
7. **Performance** — N+1 queries, unbounded collections, missing indexes, large payloads

For each checklist item: use Grep to find matching patterns across the codebase, then use Read to examine surrounding context for confirmation. Do not report a pattern match as a finding without reading the context — many patterns have legitimate uses.

### 3.4 Finding limits

Cap detailed findings at 50. If more than 50 findings are identified, keep the top 50 by severity and provide a summary table for the rest (category, count, example file).

### 3.5 Finding format

Every finding MUST include:
- **Severity**: Critical, Important, Worth noting, or Opportunity
- **Category**: Security, Correctness, Reliability, Tests, Architecture, Tech Debt, or Performance
- **Title**: One-line description
- **Location**: `file:line` for code findings. For non-code findings (missing tests, dependency vulnerabilities, architectural patterns), reference the most relevant file or component.
- **Evidence**: The specific code or pattern found
- **Recommendation**: What to do about it

No hallucinating findings. Every finding must reference a specific file and line (or component for non-code findings). If you cannot point to it in the codebase, do not report it.

### 3.6 Severity calibration

Use these exact definitions:

- **Critical**: Exploitable security vulnerability, data loss risk, correctness bug that produces wrong results in production. Would block a release.
- **Important**: Significant reliability risk, missing error handling on critical paths, test gaps on core business logic, architectural problems that will compound. Worth scheduling promptly.
- **Worth noting**: Code smells, minor tech debt, style inconsistencies, non-critical performance issues. Address during normal development when touching nearby code.
- **Opportunity**: Not a problem — a concrete improvement that would make the codebase better. New patterns, better abstractions, tooling upgrades.

---

## Phase 4: Report Generation

### 4.1 Load report template

Read the report template:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/skills/gstack/codebase-audit/report-template.md
```

Use this template to structure the final report. If the template is missing, use the structure described below as a fallback.

### 4.2 Calculate health score

Start at 100 and deduct per finding:
- Critical: -25 points each
- Important: -10 points each
- Worth noting: -3 points each
- Opportunity: no deduction

Floor at 0. No score exceeds 100. The model is deliberately simple — use regression mode to track relative improvement rather than fixating on the absolute number.

### 4.3 Write the report

Resolve the project slug and create the output directory:

```bash
eval $(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)
mkdir -p ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/audits
```

Generate a datetime stamp and write the report to `~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/audits/{datetime}-audit.md`. Use format `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS` for the datetime (e.g., `2026-03-20-143022`).

The report should contain:
1. **Header**: Project name, date, mode, health score
2. **Executive Summary**: 3-5 sentence overview of codebase health
3. **Project Profile**: Language, framework, size, test coverage estimate, git activity
4. **Architecture Diagram**: ASCII diagram from Phase 2 (skip in quick mode)
5. **Findings by Severity**: Grouped by severity, then by category within each severity level
6. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Summary from Phase 1 CVE check (if any found)
7. **Churn Hotspots**: Top files by change frequency and bus factor
8. **Summary Table**: Category × severity matrix with counts
9. **Top 5 Priorities**: The 5 most impactful things to fix, in order
10. **Recommendations**: Strategic suggestions beyond individual findings

For quick mode, the slim report contains only: Header, Executive Summary, Project Profile, Health Score, Top 5 Findings.

### 4.4 Write baseline JSON

Write a companion `{datetime}-baseline.json` file in the same directory. This is used for regression comparison on future runs.

Schema:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "datetime": "2026-03-20T14:30:22Z",
  "mode": "full",
  "slug": "org-project",
  "health_score": 72,
  "codebase": {
    "loc": 24500,
    "languages": ["TypeScript", "Python"],
    "framework": "Next.js",
    "test_files": 47,
    "dependency_vulns": 3
  },
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "<sha256 hash of file + category + title>",
      "severity": "critical",
      "category": "security",
      "title": "SQL injection in user search",
      "file": "src/api/users.ts",
      "line": 42
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "critical": 1,
    "important": 5,
    "notable": 12,
    "opportunity": 8,
    "total": 26
  }
}
```

Each finding gets a content-based ID: a hash of `file + category + title`. This enables stable comparison across runs.

### 4.5 Regression comparison

If a previous `baseline.json` exists in the same audits directory AND the current mode is full (not quick):

1. Load the most recent previous baseline
2. Compare findings by their content-based IDs
3. Compute:
   - **Fixed**: findings in previous baseline not present in current run
   - **New**: findings in current run not present in previous baseline
   - **Persistent**: findings present in both
   - **Score delta**: current score minus previous score
4. Add a "Regression Summary" section to the report showing these deltas

If no previous baseline exists, skip regression comparison.

### 4.6 Conversation summary

After writing the report file, print a summary directly to the conversation. This is what the user sees immediately:

1. **Health Score**: The number and a one-line interpretation (e.g., "72/100 — solid foundation with some important gaps")
2. **Executive Summary**: 3-5 sentences
3. **Top 5 Priorities**: Numbered list with severity, title, and file reference
4. **Summary Table**: Category × severity counts
5. **Report location**: Full path to the written report
6. **Regression delta** (if applicable): Score change, count of fixed/new findings

### 4.7 Next steps

After printing the conversation summary, use AskUserQuestion to offer next steps:

"Audit complete. What would you like to do?"

Options:
- **A) Show all findings inline** — Display all findings grouped by severity in this conversation
- **B) Fix selected findings** — Pick which findings to address now. I'll create a plan and start fixing.
- **C) Quick fixes only** — Auto-fix mechanical issues (gitignore patterns, narrowing broad exception catches, adding named constants, etc.) without a full plan. Commits each fix atomically.
- **D) Done** — I'll review the report file later

**If the user picks A:** Print all findings grouped by severity. Then re-ask with options B, C, D.

**If the user picks B:** Present each Important and Critical finding as a numbered item. Ask which ones to fix (user can pick by number, "all", or "all important"). Then classify the selected findings:

**Mechanical fixes** (gitignore patterns, narrowing exception types, adding timeouts, adding constants): Apply directly — commit each atomically. These don't need a plan review.

**Substantive fixes** (architecture changes, error handling redesign, security fixes, test coverage additions, anything touching multiple files or requiring design decisions): These should go through the gstack review pipeline. Recommend:
1. Create a plan summarizing the selected findings and proposed fixes
2. Run `/plan-eng-review` on the plan (required shipping gate)
3. If the fixes involve scope/product decisions, suggest `/plan-ceo-review` first
4. Then execute the reviewed plan

Present this as a recommendation, not a gate. If the user wants to skip reviews for a simple fix, let them. But for anything touching 3+ files or involving architectural judgment, push for the review pipeline — that's how gstack ensures quality.

After all fixes (whether mechanical or reviewed), re-run the relevant checklist patterns to verify the fixes resolved the findings.

**If the user picks C:** Identify findings that are purely mechanical fixes — no judgment calls, no architectural decisions. Examples:
- Adding patterns to .gitignore
- Narrowing `except Exception` to specific exception types
- Replacing magic numbers with named constants
- Adding missing `timeout=` parameters to HTTP calls
- Adding `t.Parallel()` to independent tests

For each mechanical fix: apply the fix, commit atomically, move to the next. Skip anything that requires a design decision. Report what was fixed and what was skipped.

**If the user picks D:** End the skill. The report and baseline are saved.

---

## Edge Cases

- **Empty or binary-only project**: If the codebase has fewer than 10 text files or fewer than 100 LOC, write a brief report noting this and exit gracefully. Do not force findings.
- **Not a git repo**: Skip all git-dependent steps (churn analysis, bus factor, recent activity). Note in the report that git history was unavailable.
- **Zero findings**: If the audit produces zero findings, note this in the report with a caveat: "Zero findings is unusual — this may indicate the checklist patterns don't match this tech stack. Consider running with a custom checklist."
- **500+ raw pattern matches**: If Grep returns an overwhelming number of matches for a pattern, sample the first 20 and note the total count. Do not read all 500+.
- **Large codebase scoping**: For codebases >50K LOC, AskUserQuestion fires in Phase 1 to scope the audit. Do not attempt to read the entire codebase.
- **Missing checklist**: If the checklist file at `~/.claude/skills/gstack/codebase-audit/checklist.md` is unreadable, STOP with an error message. The audit cannot run without it.
- **Network failures**: If dependency audit commands fail due to network issues, skip gracefully and note the skip in the report.

## Key Rules

1. You MUST NOT modify any source code. Your only Write operations are the report and baseline files in `~/.gstack/`.
2. Findings that reference specific code MUST include `file:line`. Findings about missing functionality (missing tests, missing error handling), dependency vulnerabilities, or architectural patterns should reference the most relevant file or component instead. Never report a finding you cannot anchor to something concrete in the codebase.
3. Reports are saved to your home directory (`~/.gstack/`), not the project directory. They may contain security findings — do not commit them to public repos.
4. No hallucinating findings. Every finding must reference a specific file and line (or component for non-code findings). If you can't point to it, don't report it.
5. Use the severity calibration definitions exactly as specified. Do not inflate or deflate severity.
6. In quick mode, respect the 2-minute target. Do not run Phase 2 or the full Phase 3 checklist.
7. AskUserQuestion fires in three places: (1) Phase 1 if >50K LOC, to scope the audit; (2) end of Phase 4, for next steps (show findings / fix / quick fix / done); (3) within fix mode (B), for finding selection. Do not use it elsewhere.
8. All bash blocks are self-contained. Do not rely on shell variables persisting between code blocks.
9. When reading files for context, read enough surrounding lines to understand the code — do not make judgments from a single line in isolation.
10. Cap detailed findings at 50. Summarize overflow in a table.
11. Be aware of your knowledge cutoff. Do not flag dependency versions, language versions, or API usage as "deprecated" or "nonexistent" based solely on your training data. If uncertain whether a version exists, state the uncertainty rather than asserting it as a finding.
12. Always use the Read tool to read files — never use `cat` via Bash. The Read tool provides better context and is the expected convention.
13. Do NOT write to plan files or enter plan mode during the audit phases (1-4). The audit produces a report, not an implementation plan. Write only to `~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/audits/` during the audit. If the user then selects "Fix selected findings" or "Quick fixes only" in the next-steps prompt, you may edit source code and commit changes — but the audit phase itself is always read-only.
