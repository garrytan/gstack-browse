## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"
# Learnings count
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || true
_LEARN_FILE="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}/learnings.jsonl"

# Session timeline
_SESSION_ID="$$-$(date +%s)"
_TEL_START=$(date +%s)

```

## Voice

**Tone:** direct, concrete, precise. Sound like a researcher, not a consultant.
Name the file, the function, the exact parameter. No filler.

**Writing rules:**
- No em dashes. Use commas, periods, or "..." instead.
- No AI vocabulary: delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, etc.
- Short paragraphs. Be specific with numbers and file paths.
- End with what to do next.

## Context Recovery

After compaction or at session start, check for recent project artifacts:

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
_PROJ="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}"
if [ -d "$_PROJ" ]; then
  echo "--- RECENT ARTIFACTS ---"
  [ -f "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" ] && tail -5 "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl"
  echo "--- END ARTIFACTS ---"
fi
```

If artifacts are listed, mention recent activity briefly.

## AskUserQuestion — MUST use the tool

When the workflow says to ask the researcher a question, **you MUST call the AskUserQuestion tool**.
Do NOT just print the options as text in the chat. The tool renders clickable options in the UI.

**How to call it:** Use the AskUserQuestion tool with a `question` string and an `options` array.
Include a recommendation in the question text itself.

**Question format:**
1. Re-ground: state the project, branch, and current task (1-2 sentences)
2. Explain the decision in plain English
3. Add `RECOMMENDATION: [option]` with a one-line reason
4. The options array provides the choices — keep them short and actionable

Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes.

## Completeness Principle

AI makes completeness near-free. Always recommend the complete option over shortcuts.

**Effort reference:**

| Task type | Human team | CC+research-stack | Compression |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Boilerplate | 2 days | 15 min | ~100x |
| Parameter sweep | 1 day | 15 min | ~50x |
| Analysis + plots | 4 hours | 15 min | ~20x |
| Hypothesis spec | 2 hours | 5 min | ~25x |

## Repo Ownership

If working in a collaborative repo, flag issues outside your branch via
AskUserQuestion rather than fixing directly (may be someone else's work).

## Search Before Building

Before building anything unfamiliar, **search first.**
- Search for "{runtime} {thing} built-in"
- Search for "{thing} best practice {current year}"
- Check official docs

Three layers: **Layer 1** (tried and true), **Layer 2** (new and popular),
**Layer 3** (first principles). Prize Layer 3 above all.

## Completion Status

When completing a skill workflow, report status:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed with issues to note.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required.

### Operational Learning

Before completing, reflect:
- Did any commands fail unexpectedly?
- Did you discover a project-specific quirk?
- Did something take longer than expected?

If yes, log an operational learning:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-learnings-log '{"skill":"hypothesis","type":"operational","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"source":"observed"}'
```

### Telemetry (run last)

```bash
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-timeline-log '{"skill":"hypothesis","event":"completed","branch":"'$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)'","outcome":"OUTCOME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'"}' 2>/dev/null || true
```

Replace `OUTCOME` with success/error/abort.

# /hypothesis — Structure Research Ideas

Transform a natural language research idea into a structured, testable hypothesis
with an experiment specification ready for `/run-experiment`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Capture the idea

The user provides a research idea in natural language. Examples:
- "Surface code threshold scales as 1/distance for bit-flip noise"
- "MWPM decoder outperforms Union-Find at low noise rates for rotated surface codes"
- "Increasing batch size beyond 1024 shows diminishing returns for this model"

If the idea is vague, **call the AskUserQuestion tool** to clarify. Example:
- question: "Your idea is broad. Which aspect should we focus on?"
- options: ["Measuring <quantity A>", "Comparing <method A> vs <method B>", "Characterizing <behavior>"]

Tailor the options to the specific idea. Do NOT just print text.

### Step 2: Check past learnings

## Prior Learnings

Search for relevant learnings from previous sessions:

```bash
_CROSS_PROJ=$(~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-config get cross_project_learnings 2>/dev/null || echo "unset")
echo "CROSS_PROJECT: $_CROSS_PROJ"
if [ "$_CROSS_PROJ" = "true" ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-learnings-search --limit 10 --cross-project 2>/dev/null || true
else
  ~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-learnings-search --limit 10 2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

If `CROSS_PROJECT` is `unset` (first time): Use AskUserQuestion:

> gstack can search learnings from your other projects on this machine to find
> patterns that might apply here. This stays local (no data leaves your machine).
> Recommended for solo developers. Skip if you work on multiple client codebases
> where cross-contamination would be a concern.

Options:
- A) Enable cross-project learnings (recommended)
- B) Keep learnings project-scoped only

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-config set cross_project_learnings true`
If B: run `~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-config set cross_project_learnings false`

Then re-run the search with the appropriate flag.

If learnings are found, incorporate them into your analysis. When a review finding
matches a past learning, display:

**"Prior learning applied: [key] (confidence N/10, from [date])"**

This makes the compounding visible. The user should see that gstack is getting
smarter on their codebase over time.

Search for related hypotheses and experiments. If similar work was done before:
- **If it succeeded:** Note it and suggest building on those results
- **If it failed (dead-end):** See below

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
_LEARN_FILE="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}/learnings.jsonl"
if [ -f "$_LEARN_FILE" ]; then
  grep -i "<relevant_keyword>" "$_LEARN_FILE" | tail -5
fi
```

**If a similar hypothesis was previously marked as a dead-end:**

**Call the AskUserQuestion tool:**
- question: "A similar hypothesis '<prior_slug>' was previously abandoned: '<reason>'. How would you like to proceed?"
- options: ["Try with different parameters", "Redesign the approach", "Proceed anyway — my setup differs", "Skip this hypothesis"]

If "Try with different parameters": Continue to Step 3, noting which parameters to change.
If "Redesign the approach": Return to Step 1 to reformulate the idea.
If "Proceed anyway": Continue to Step 3 with a note about the prior dead-end.
If "Skip": End the skill and suggest the researcher explore alternative ideas.

### Step 3: Read project conventions

## Read Project Conventions

Before generating any code, read the project's CLAUDE.md and look for a `## Research conventions` section.

```bash
grep -A 50 "## Research conventions" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_CONVENTIONS"
```

If conventions ARE found, parse them and use them to guide all code generation.
Every generated file must follow these conventions exactly. Convention compliance
is more important than code elegance.

---

If `NO_CONVENTIONS` is printed, the project has no research conventions yet.
**Auto-detect the project and write conventions to CLAUDE.md before continuing.**

**Step 1: Auto-detect project characteristics.**

```bash
echo "=== LANGUAGE DETECTION ==="
if ls *.py **/*.py 2>/dev/null | head -1 >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "DETECTED: python"; fi
if ls *.jl **/*.jl 2>/dev/null | head -1 >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "DETECTED: julia"; fi
if ls *.m **/*.m 2>/dev/null | head -1 >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "DETECTED: matlab"; fi
if ls *.rs **/*.rs 2>/dev/null | head -1 >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "DETECTED: rust"; fi
if ls *.cpp **/*.cpp 2>/dev/null | head -1 >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "DETECTED: cpp"; fi

echo "=== DEPENDENCIES ==="
cat requirements.txt 2>/dev/null || cat pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null | head -30 || cat Project.toml 2>/dev/null | head -20 || echo "NO_DEPS_FILE"

echo "=== TEST COMMAND ==="
if [ -f pyproject.toml ] && grep -q pytest pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null; then echo "DETECTED: pytest"; fi
if [ -f Makefile ] && grep -q "test:" Makefile 2>/dev/null; then grep "test:" Makefile | head -1; fi

echo "=== EXISTING RESEARCH ==="
ls research/ 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_RESEARCH_DIR"
```

**Step 2: Build a conventions draft from the detection results.**

Based on what was detected, draft a `## Research conventions` section. Fill in what was detected, leave reasonable defaults for the rest. Use this format:

```
## Research conventions

language: <detected language, e.g. "python 3.11+">
test_command: <detected or "pytest -x">
compute_backend: local
random_seed_strategy: explicit

preferred_libraries:
  - <libraries from requirements.txt/pyproject.toml>

naming:
  experiments: snake_case
  hypotheses: snake_case

imports:
  - <detected import conventions, e.g. "numpy as np">
```

**Step 3: Present the draft to the researcher for confirmation.**

**You MUST call the AskUserQuestion tool** with these options (do NOT just print the options as text):
- question: Show the drafted conventions and ask "Does this look right? I'll append this to CLAUDE.md."
- options: ["Looks good, save it", "Let me edit it first"]

**Step 4: Append to CLAUDE.md.**

If the researcher approves, append the conventions section to CLAUDE.md using the Edit tool. If CLAUDE.md doesn't exist, create it with the Write tool.

Then continue with the original skill workflow using the newly written conventions.

### Step 4: Generate hypothesis document

Create a slug from the idea (e.g., "threshold-scaling", "decoder-comparison").

Write `research/hypotheses/<slug>.md`:

```markdown
# Hypothesis: <title>

**Date:** <today>
**Author:** <from git config>
**Status:** proposed

## Claim
<one clear sentence stating the hypothesis>

## Prediction
<what specific outcome would confirm or deny this>

## Method
<how to test it — simulation approach, analysis method>

## Parameters
<key experimental parameters and their ranges>

## Success Criteria
<quantitative threshold for accepting/rejecting the hypothesis>

## Estimated Compute
<rough estimate: seconds/minutes/hours, local/cluster>

## Related Work
<links to past experiments, learnings, or papers>
```

### Step 5: Generate experiment spec

Write `research/experiments/<slug>/spec.yaml`:

```yaml
hypothesis: research/hypotheses/<slug>.md
created: <today>
status: pending

parameters:
  # Key experimental parameters with ranges
  # Example for QEC:
  # distances: [3, 5, 7, 9]
  # noise_rates: [0.001, 0.003, 0.005, 0.008, 0.01]
  # num_shots: 100000

baseline:
  path: research/baselines/<slug>/metrics.json  # or null if no baseline
  description: <what to compare against>

conventions:
  language: <from CLAUDE.md>
  imports: <from CLAUDE.md>
  naming: <from CLAUDE.md>

seeds: [42, 123, 456]  # default seeds for reproducibility
```

### Step 6: Create directory structure

```bash
mkdir -p research/hypotheses
mkdir -p research/experiments/<slug>
mkdir -p research/baselines/<slug>
mkdir -p research/results/<slug>
mkdir -p research/reports
```

### Step 7: Review with researcher

Show the generated hypothesis and spec to the researcher. Print a summary of the
hypothesis, parameters, and success criteria as text. Then **call the AskUserQuestion tool**:

- question: "Hypothesis: <claim>. Parameters: <summary>. Success criteria: <threshold>. RECOMMENDATION: Save it — the spec looks complete."
- options: ["Looks good, save it", "Modify the hypothesis", "Modify the parameters", "Discard"]

If "Looks good": Write files and record to learnings.
If "Modify the hypothesis" or "Modify the parameters": Iterate on the specific part.
If "Discard": Do not create files.

### Step 8: Record to learnings

## Capture Learnings

If you discovered a non-obvious pattern, pitfall, or architectural insight during
this session, log it for future sessions:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-learnings-log '{"skill":"hypothesis","type":"TYPE","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"source":"SOURCE","files":["path/to/relevant/file"]}'
```

**Types:** `pattern` (reusable approach), `pitfall` (what NOT to do), `preference`
(user stated), `architecture` (structural decision), `tool` (library/framework insight),
`operational` (project environment/CLI/workflow knowledge).

**Sources:** `observed` (you found this in the code), `user-stated` (user told you),
`inferred` (AI deduction), `cross-model` (both Claude and Codex agree).

**Confidence:** 1-10. Be honest. An observed pattern you verified in the code is 8-9.
An inference you're not sure about is 4-5. A user preference they explicitly stated is 10.

**files:** Include the specific file paths this learning references. This enables
staleness detection: if those files are later deleted, the learning can be flagged.

**Only log genuine discoveries.** Don't log obvious things. Don't log things the user
already knows. A good test: would this insight save time in a future session? If yes, log it.

Log the hypothesis creation:

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/research-stack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
_LEARN_FILE="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}/learnings.jsonl"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$_LEARN_FILE")"
echo '{"type":"hypothesis","slug":"<slug>","claim":"<claim>","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' >> "$_LEARN_FILE"
```

## Output

After completion, tell the researcher:

```
Hypothesis created:
  research/hypotheses/<slug>.md
  research/experiments/<slug>/spec.yaml

Next step: /run-experiment research/experiments/<slug>/spec.yaml
```
